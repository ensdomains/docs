### Abstract

This ENSIP defines a specific ENS name, ###INSERTNAMEHERE###.eth to be used for demonstration purposes..

### Motivation

When writing documentation, it is helpful to refer to a concrete name of something to inspire thoughts about how that thing might work.

For example, with HTTPS websites hosted on legacy DNS we can refer specifically to https://example.com.

Further motivation is discussed in the comparable [RFC 2606](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2606.html) and [RFC 6761](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6761.html). One important reason is that propogating documentation for a specific name, when that name is controlled by an individual party, gives that party a strong motivation to make malicious use of that name.

This specification standardizes one ENS name we can use for similar purposes.

### Specification

#### ENS Name

The name ###INSERTNAMEHERE###.eth shall be reserved for this purpose.

It is currently locked and nobody is able to make any use of this name. Therefore everybody is free to refer to this name.

#### Clients

A client website or other tool using ENS MAY warn or error before allowing interaction with ###INSERTNAMEHERE###.eth as this can be a known undesirible action.

### Examples

A documentation page may say:

> You can input your own ENS name such as ###INSERTNAMEHERE###.eth into the box.

### Backwards Compatibility

Not applicable.

### Security Considerations

None.
