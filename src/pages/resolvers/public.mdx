# Public Resolver

:::info
Find the address of the latest public resolver on the [deployments page](/learn/deployments).
:::

The public resolver is a general-purpose ENS resolver that is suitable for most user needs.
It permits the owner of a name to update their records, includes permissions, and stores its data on layer-1 ethereum.

Most ENS names registered through the ENS Manager will use the latest version of the public resolver by default.
Names that resolve to a supported public resolver are editable from within the ENS Manager.

If you'd like to take a peek under the hood you can view the [public resolver source code](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol) on GitHub.

## Features

The public resolver supports the following features:

- [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137) - Contract address interface (`addr()`)
- [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) - Interface Detection (`supportsInterface()`)
- [EIP-181](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-181) - Reverse Resolution (`name()`)
- [EIP-205](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-205) - ABI Resolution for contracts (`ABI()`)
- [EIP-619](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-619) - SECP256k1 public keys (`pubkey()`)
- [EIP-634](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-634) - Text records (`text()`)
- [EIP-1577](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1577) - Content hash resolution (`contenthash()`)
- [EIP-2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304) - Multicoin support (`addr()`)
- [ENSIP-19](/ensip/19#default-address) - Default EVM address resolution

:::note
While the `PublicResolver` provides a default implementation, remember that custom resolvers exist. It is therefore not recommended to hardcode any addresses. To ensure a safe implementation, always use the `supportsInterface()` method to check for the existence of a specific interface. See [Interacting with a Resolver](/resolvers/interacting) for how to do this.

## Default EVM Address Resolution

The latest public resolver supports the notion of a "default EVM address" for a name, represented by coinType `0`. If this is set, it will be returned by the `addr(bytes32 node, uint256 coinType)` function regardless of the `coinType` parameter, unless overridden by a more specific address.

This pairs nicely with the default reverse registrar when dealing with [L2 primary names](/web/reverse#l2-primary-names).
