# Writing a Resolver

Every ENS name has a resolver, which is responsible for resolving information about a name.

Resolvers are a core part of the ENS protocol. They give each name, represented as a ["node"](/resolution/names#namehash), the power to control the resolution process for itself and all of its subnames. Resolvers were originally standardized in [EIP 137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137), but have since received a few updates such as [EIP 181](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-181), [EIP 2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304), and [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10).

You can find the latest default resolver implementation, called the Public Resolver, on [GitHub](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/mainnet/contracts/resolvers/PublicResolver.sol) and [Etherscan](/learn/deployments).

## Resolver Interface

You can view an extended list of resolver methods [here](/resolvers/interfaces), however a simple interface might look something like this:

```solidity
interface IMyResolver {
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool);
    function addr(bytes32 node) external view returns (address payable);
    function addr(bytes32 node, uint256 coinType) external view returns (bytes memory);
    function contenthash(bytes32 node) external view returns (bytes memory);
    function text(bytes32 node, string calldata key) external view returns (string memory);

    function setAddr(bytes32 node, address addr) external;
    function setAddr(bytes32 node, uint256 coinType, bytes calldata a) external;
    function setContenthash(bytes32 node, bytes calldata hash) external;
    function setText(bytes32 node, string calldata key, string calldata value) external;
}
```

## Wildcard Resolution

In [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10) a new `resolve()` method was added to the resolver interface to allow for wildcard resolution.

```solidity
interface IExtendedResolver {
    /**
     * @dev Performs ENS name resolution for the supplied name and resolution data.
     * @param name The name to resolve, in normalised and DNS-encoded form.
     * @param data The resolution data, as specified in ENSIP-10.
     * @return The result of resolving the name.
     */
    function resolve(
        bytes memory name,
        bytes memory data
    ) external view returns (bytes memory);
}
```

:::note
Don't forget to add `0x9061b923` to your [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/) `supportsInterface()` implementation.

## Onchain Resolvers

By default, ENS names use the [Public Resolver](/resolvers/public) which stores all data onchain. An extremely basic resolver that stores a mapping of ENS names to addresses might look like this:

```solidity
contract OnchainResolver {
    mapping(bytes32 node => address addr) public addr;

    function setAddr(bytes32 node, address _addr) external {
        addr[node] = _addr;
    }

    function supportsInterface(
        bytes4 interfaceID
    ) external pure returns (bool) {
        return
            interfaceID == OnchainResolver.supportsInterface.selector ||
            // function addr(bytes32 node) external view returns (address)
            interfaceID == 0x3b3b57de;
    }
}
```

:::note
This is not secure since it doesn't implement any form of access control for updating a name's address, and is only suitable for demonstration purposes.
:::

Since the mapping is stored internally, it costs gas for the owner of a name to update their address. This is great for a maximal decentralization, but is not always practical.

## Offchain Resolvers

An offchain resolver is a resolver that implements CCIP Read to defer a name's resolution to an HTTP server. This server can then load data from any source including offchain databases, APIs, or other blockchains. [Learn more about CCIP Read](/resolvers/ccip-read).

An equivalent offchain resolver to the above onchain example looks something like this:

```solidity
contract OffchainResolver {
    string public url =
        "https://docs.ens.domains/api/example/basic-gateway";

    error OffchainLookup(
        address sender,
        string[] urls,
        bytes callData,
        bytes4 callbackFunction,
        bytes extraData
    );

    function addr(bytes32 node) external view returns (address) {
        bytes memory callData = abi.encodeWithSelector(
            OffchainResolver.addr.selector,
            node
        );

        string[] memory urls = new string[](1);
        urls[0] = url;

        revert OffchainLookup(
            address(this),
            urls,
            callData,
            OffchainResolver.addrCallback.selector,
            abi.encode(callData, address(this))
        );
    }

    function addrCallback(
        bytes calldata response,
        bytes calldata
    ) external pure returns (address) {
        address _addr = abi.decode(response, (address));
        return _addr;
    }

    function supportsInterface(
        bytes4 interfaceID
    ) external pure returns (bool) {
        return
            interfaceID == OffchainResolver.supportsInterface.selector ||
            interfaceID == OffchainResolver.addr.selector;
    }
}
```

:::note
This is not secure since it doesn't implement any form of verification in the callback function, and is only suitable for demonstration purposes.

Any ENS name that sets its resolver to this contract would resolve to whatever address the Gateway returns, which can be changed at any time offchain for free. See the [gateway code here](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/blob/master/functions/api/example/basic-gateway.ts).

For the same functionality to work with subnames, you'd need to implement the `resolve()` method from ENSIP-10. A feature-complete example can be found [here](https://github.com/ensdomains/ccip-tools/blob/master/contracts/OffchainResolver.sol), and easily deployed via [ccip.tools](https://ccip.tools/).
