# Resolution

The process by which we load information about a name is called resolution. It's a simple process, but it's important to understand.
Here is a diagram of some of the contracts involved when resolving a name.

The resolution process involves multiple parts. Most notably the [Registry](/registry/ens), multiple Registrars ([ETH Registrar](/registry/eth), [DNS Registrar](/registry/dns), [Reverse Registrar](/registry/reverse), etc)
and the concept of a [Resolver](/resolvers/quickstart).

## How to resolve

Here is a little peek at what happens under the hood of your favourite library when you do a name lookup.

### 1. Find the Resolver

Every name has a "resolver". A resolver is simply a contract that implements the [resolver specification](/resolvers/quickstart) and can be queried for information about a name.
To get the resolver responsible for a name, you can query [The Registry](/registry/ens) for the `resolver` of a name.

:::code-group

```solidity [Solidity]
ENS.resolver(bytes32 node) view returns (address)
```

```tsx [Wagmi]
// https://wagmi.sh/react/api/hooks/useEnsResolver
import { normalize } from 'viem/ens'
import { useEnsResolver } from 'wagmi'

export const MyResolver = () => {
  const { data: myResolver } = useEnsResolver({
    name: normalize('nick.eth'), // The name to lookup
  })

  return <div>{myResolver}</div>
}
```

```ts [Ethers]
const resolver = await provider.getResolver('nick.eth')
```

```ts [viem]
// https://viem.sh/docs/ens/actions/getEnsResolver.html
import { normalize } from 'viem/ens'

import { publicClient } from './client'

const ensResolver = await publicClient.getEnsResolver({
  name: normalize('nick.eth'),
})
```

```py [Web3.py]
# https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ens_overview.html#working-with-resolvers
from ens.auto import ns

resolver = ns.resolver('alice.eth')
```

:::

To verify which specifications are implemented by a resolver, you can call the `supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID)` on the resolver with the interfaceID you would like to test for.

### 2. Query the Resolver

Now you have found the resolver responsible for the name in question, you can query it for the information you are interested in.
There are many ways you can query the resolver, `addr()` `text()` `contenthash()` `abi()` etc.

If the resolver supports text records, you can call `text()` to get that text record for the name.
More about loading information from a resolver can be found [here](/resolvers/interacting).

#### Wildcard Resolution

In addition, all of the above functions can be sent to the `resolve()` function, specified in [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10).
This allows for not only multicall functionality, but also easier implementation of EIP-3668, and more.
Most clients & many resolvers utilize wildcard resolution as their primary form of resolution.

## Reverse Resolution

Due to the modular nature of how ENS is designed, it is also possible to lookup the "primary name" of an address.
This process actually uses forward resolution under the hood, you read that right - its just forwards resolution.

To look up the primary name of a given address, you must do a resolver lookup for `addr.reverse` and then query the `name()` field on the resolver.
This name field returns the "preferred" name for the address. You should always follow up a reverse lookup with a forward lookup to verify that the resulting name points back to the original address. If the address doesn't match, display the address rather than the reversed name.

```solidity
/// @dev The starting point for all ENS resolution is the Registry
ENS ens = 0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e;

/// @dev The node hash for "addr.reverse"
bytes32 ADDR_REVERSE_NODE = 0x91d1777781884d03a6757a803996e38de2a42967fb37eeaca72729271025a9e2;

/// @dev Returns the node hash for a given account's reverse records, `{address}.addr.reverse`
function reverseNode(address addr) public pure returns (bytes32) {
  return keccak256(
      abi.encodePacked(ADDR_REVERSE_NODE, sha3HexAddress(addr))
    );
}

/// @dev Get the reverse record for an address
function getReverseRecord(address addr) public view returns (string) {
    bytes32 reverseNodeHash = reverseNode(addr);

    // Get the resolver for the reverse node
    Resolver resolver = ens.resolver(reverseNodeHash);

    // Get the address's preferred name
    return resolver.name(reverseNodeHash);
}
```

:::info
**Important**: The client MUST perform a forward resolution on a user's reverse record to verify the address matches the one you are looking up. The example above does not perform this verification.

Please note that many libraries already have functionality to do this. You can read more about it in the [Getting a Primary Name](/web/reverse) section.
