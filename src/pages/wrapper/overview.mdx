The **Name Wrapper** is a contract for ENS that allows you to "wrap" any ENS name into a ERC-1155 NFT.

## Without the Name Wrapper

Before the Name Wrapper, only .eth 2LDs (second-level domains, like `ens.eth`) had ERC-721 NFTs associated with them, unless the owner created a separate custom contract.

**Parent-Controlled Fuses:**

- [Fuses](/wrapper/fuses) that only the parent owner can burn
- "Perks" that can be given to the owner of a name

**Example:** By burning `CAN_EXTEND_EXPIRY`, you allow the owner to
extend/renew their own subname

**Owner-Controlled Fuses:**

- [Fuses](/wrapper/fuses) that either the owner or parent owner can burn
- "Permissions" that can be revoked on a name

**Example:** By burning `CANNOT_TRANSFER`, the wrapped NFT can no longer be
transferred or sold.

**Subname Fuses:**

- The parent owner has the power to burn fuses when creating subnames
- Decides what perks, permissions, or guarantees to give to subname owners

With this new contract, you can wrap:

- Any .eth name or subname (e.g. `name.eth`, `sub.name.eth`)
- Any DNS name or subname (e.g. `name.com`, `sub.name.com`)

Unwrapped .eth 2LDs have the concept of a separate **Owner** (Registrant) and **Manager** (Controller).

This changes after you wrap the name, because there is only a single account that serves as both the **Owner** and **Manager** for the wrapped name.
