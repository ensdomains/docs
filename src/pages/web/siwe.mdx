# Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE) [A specification that leverages Ethereum signatures to perform authentication]

[ERC-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) defines a message format that a user signs using their keys to authenticate.

An example payload looks like the following:

```
localhost wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:
0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3B5

This is a test statement.

URI: https://localhost/login
Version: 1
Chain ID: 1
Nonce: abcdef1234567890
Issued At: 2023-01-30T00:00:00.000Z
```

After authentication, an app may resolve the user's ENS name and profile, as well as other [onchain resources](https://docs.siwe.xyz/quickstart/retrieve-onchain-data).
