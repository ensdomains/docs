# Primary Names

We can all agree 42-character long machine-optimized addresses (eg. 0x225...c3b5) are not aesthetically pleasing.
Fortunately, it is super easy to retrieve a user's preferred name, and this page will show you how.

<Card className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2">
  <span className="font-medium">0xb8c...67d5</span>
  <span>to</span>
  <EnsProfile name="nick.eth" hideAddress />
</Card>

In order to convert them to human-readable names, we use [the reverse registrar](/registry/reverse).
The reverse registrar is a smart contract that allows users to register their preferred name, referred to as their "primary name" for simplicity purposes.

With the introduction of L2 Primary Names, addresses can now set a unique primary name for each chain they operate on. Additionally, users can set a default reverse record on Ethereum Mainnet (L1) that serves as a fallback when no chain-specific primary name is set. This functionality exists on Ethereum Mainnet and is [now available on L2s](#l2-primary-names) as well.

## Getting a Primary Name

:::info
**Important**: After retrieving a name from reverse resolution, you **must** verify it by performing a forward resolution on that name to confirm it still resolves to the original address. This prevents spoofing or misconfiguration. If the addresses don't match, display the original address instead of the name.
:::

Looking up a users primary name is very simple. In most web3 libraries (wagmi, viem, ethers, web3py, etc.), you will find a built-in function to do a lookup by address as shown below. In most cases, the library will handle the verification for you.

:::info
All primary name requests should be made via the [Universal Resolver](https://docs.ens.domains/web/resolution#universal-resolver), which handles both L1 and L2 primary name resolution automatically. Most application developers don't need to worry about this implementation detail because it's already integrated into popular web3 libraries.
:::

Note that ENS resolution starts from Ethereum Mainnet and can resolve primary names across different chains, including L2-specific primary names.

:::code-group

```tsx [Wagmi]
// https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useEnsName
import { useEnsName } from 'wagmi'
import { mainnet } from 'wagmi/chains'

export const Name = () => {
  const { data: name } = useEnsName({
    address: '0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5',
    chainId: mainnet.id, // resolution always starts from L1
  })

  return <div>Name: {name}</div>
}
```

```ts [Ethers v5]
const address = '0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5';
const name = await provider.lookupAddress(address);

// Always verify the forward resolution
if (name) {
    const resolvedAddress = await provider.resolveName(name);
    if (resolvedAddress !== address) {
        // If verification fails, use the original address
        return address;
    }
}
```

```ts [Viem]
// https://viem.sh/docs/ens/actions/getEnsName.html
import { publicClient } from './client'

const ensName = await publicClient.getEnsName({
  address: '0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5',
})
```

```py [Web3.py]
# https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ens_overview.html#get-the-ens-name-for-an-address
from ens.auto import ns

name = ns.name('0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5')
```

```go [Go]

func main() {
	client, _ := ethclient.Dial("https://rpc.ankr.com/eth")

	name, _ := ens.ReverseResolve(client, common.HexToAddress("0xb8c2C29ee19D8307cb7255e1Cd9CbDE883A267d5"))
	fmt.Println("Name:", name)

ðŸŽ‰ And that's it! Now you can turn all your pages from this, to this:

<Card className="flex flex-col items-center gap-2">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">

## Setting Primary Names

In some cases you might want to encourage users to set their primary name. This might be in the event you are issuing names, or want people to be part of a community.

To do so, you can use the `setName()` function on the [reverse registrar contract](/learn/deployments).

## L2 Primary Names

:::info
Primary names are now supported on both Ethereum Mainnet and popular L2s (Base, OP Mainnet, Arbitrum One, Scroll, and Linea). This enables users to have an end-to-end experience with ENS on their preferred L2.
:::

Contracts have been deployed to popular L2s that allow users to declare a name as their primary onchain identity. The contract interface is:

```solidity
/// @notice Sets the `name()` record for the reverse ENS record associated with the calling account.
/// @param name The name to set
/// @return The ENS node hash of the reverse record
function setName(string memory name) external returns (bytes32);

/// @notice Sets the `name()` record for the reverse ENS record associated with the addr provided account.
///         Can be used if the addr is a contract that is owned by an SCA.
/// @param addr The address to set the name for
/// @param name The name to set
/// @return The ENS node hash of the reverse record
function setNameForAddr(
    address addr,
    string memory name
) external returns (bytes32);

/// @notice Sets the `name()` record for the reverse ENS record associated with the contract provided that is owned with `Ownable`.
/// @param contractAddr The address of the contract to set the name for (implementing Ownable)
/// @param owner The owner of the contract (via Ownable)
/// @param name The name to set
/// @param coinTypes The coin types to set. Must be inclusive of the coin type for the contract
/// @param signatureExpiry The expiry of the signature
/// @param signature The signature of an address that will return true on isValidSignature for the owner
/// @return The ENS node hash of the reverse record
function setNameForOwnableWithSignature(
    address contractAddr,
    address owner,
    string calldata name,
    uint256[] memory coinTypes,
    uint256 signatureExpiry,
    bytes calldata signature
) external returns (bytes32);

/// @notice Sets the `name()` record for the reverse ENS record associated with the addr provided account using a signature.
/// @param addr The address to set the name for
/// @param name The name of the reverse record
/// @param coinTypes The coin types to set. Must be inclusive of the coin type for the contract
/// @param signatureExpiry Date when the signature expires
/// @param signature The signature from the addr
/// @return The ENS node hash of the reverse record
function setNameForAddrWithSignature(
    address addr,
    string calldata name,
    uint256[] calldata coinTypes,
    uint256 signatureExpiry,
    bytes calldata signature
) external returns (bytes32);
```

This provides multiple ways to set a primary name, usable for EOAs or smart contracts which is a big improvement over the current L1-only implementation.

L2 Primary Names integrate seamlessly with the default EVM address feature in the new public resolver, allowing names to automatically resolve to the correct address across different chains without requiring explicit address records for each chain.

After retrieving a name from L2 reverse resolution, you must verify it by performing a forward resolution for the corresponding cointype on that name to confirm it still resolves to the original address. Let's look at an example:

Say I own gregskril.eth on mainnet. The name resolves to my EOA `0x179A...9285` because I've set the ETH address for that name. I call `setName("gregskril.eth")` on the Base reverse registrar, and I expect that my primary name is now `gregskril.eth` on Base. But that's actually not the case.

ENS names can resolve to [different addresses on different chains](/web/resolution), and since gregskril.eth in the example above has only specified an ETH address, the verification process will fail. In order to fix this, I need to set the Base address for gregskril.eth which is on L1 in this case. This is done by calling `setAddr(namehash("gregskril.eth"), 0x179A...9285)` on the resolver for the name.

Now that gregskril.eth resolves to `0x179A...9285` when using the Base cointype, and `name(0x179A...9285)` on the Base reverse registrar returns `gregskril.eth`, my primary name is fully set.

### Setting Records

On these chains, you can set a primary name for the sender in a few ways:

- `setName()` most simply, using the `msg.sender`'s address
- `setNameForAddr()` for smart contracts that implement the Ownable pattern, where `owner() == msg.sender`
- `setNameForAddrWithSignature()` for EOAs or smart contracts with an ERC-1271 or ERC-6492 signature to set a reverse record on behalf of a user
- `setNameForOwnableWithSignature()` which combines the functionality of the previous two functions to set the reverse record on behalf of a smart contract that implements `Ownable`

### Signatures for setting records

The signature format for `setNameForAddrWithSignature` is:

```
validatorAddress, // 0xAe91c512BC1da8B00cd33dd9D9C734069e6E0fcd for testnets
functionSignature, // 0x2023a04c
name, // string name value
addr, // address to set name for
coinTypes, // array of coinTypes wanting to be set
signatureExpiry // expiry of the signature, up to 1 hour in the future
```

The signature format for `setNameForOwnableWithSignature` is:

```
validatorAddress, // 0xAe91c512BC1da8B00cd33dd9D9C734069e6E0fcd for testnets
functionSignature, // 0x975713ad
name, // string name value
contractAddr, // contract address to set name for
owner, // owner address of contract (i.e. the signature being verified)
coinTypes, // array of coinTypes wanting to be set
signatureExpiry // expiry of the signature, up to 1 hour in the future
```

## Do's and Dont's

Under no situation is it recommended to force a user to change their primary name, nor doing so without clearly notifying the user of what the transaction they are about to execute could modify.

Doing so could be seen as hostile or undesired behaviour by end users and might degrade their experience with your app.
