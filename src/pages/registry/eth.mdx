# ETH Registrar [Smart contracts responsible for the ".eth" TLD]

The ETH Registrar is a special registrar. It allows for trustless onchain name registration and is in charge of the ".eth" TLD.

## BaseRegistrar vs Controller

The ETH Registrar is split into two contracts. The [BaseRegistrar](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/ethregistrar/BaseRegistrarImplementation.sol) and the [ETHRegistrarController](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/ethregistrar/ETHRegistrarController.sol).

The BaseRegistrar is responsible for name ownership, transfers, etc (ownership related), while the Controller is responsible for registration & renewal (pricing related). This separation is done to reduce the attack surface of the registrar, and provides users with the guarantees of continued ownership of a name so long as the registrar is in place.

### Controllers

The [ETHRegistrarController](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/staging/contracts/ethregistrar/ETHRegistrarController.sol) is the main controller for the ETH Registrar, and provides a straightforward registration and renewal mechanism.

## Pricing Structure

The ETH Registrar charges a fee for registration.
This fee is paid in ETH and is set to prevent spamming the registrar.
Any protocol fees are sent to the ENS Treasury.

### Pricing Oracle

Initially, a single pricing oracle was deployed, the [StablePriceOracle](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/ethregistrar/StablePriceOracle.sol).
This contract has owner-set prices for each name length (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more).
Users do not have to interact with this oracle directly, as the controller provides functionality to determine the pricing for a registration or renewal.

### 3, 4, and 5 Letter Names

The ETH Registrar has special pricing for 3, 4, and 5 (and more) letter names. At the time of writing, a `5+` letter `.eth` will cost you `5 USD` per year.
A `4` letter `160 USD` per year, and a `3` letter `640 USD` per year.
This pricing structure is done to promote market diversity as there are an exponentially less amount of names the shorter they become.
The minimum length of a name is 3 characters.

| Name Length | Price (USD) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 5+          | 5           |
| 4           | 160         |
| 3           | 640         |

### Premium & Auctions

In addition to length-based pricing the ETH Registrar also has a premium pricing structure.
90 days after a name expires (aka after the grace period), the name will go into a Temporary Premium Auction.
The Auction is a 21 day dutch auction, meaning that the price starts high (~100 Million USD) and exponentially decrease till it hits 0 or a bid goes through.

This is done to prevent sniping of names, and ensures the name goes to the highest bidder fairly.

You can read more about the temporary premium in [this article](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7900612-temporary-premium).

### Where does the money go?

Upon registration funds are sent to the ETHRegistrarController. The controller then sends the funds to the ENS Treasury (anyone can call the `withdraw` method to trigger this).
Income from the ETH Registrar is used to fund the development of ENS, its ecosystem, and other public goods.

Read more about our spending in [Article III of the Constitution](/dao/constitution#iii-income-funds-ens-and-other-public-goods).

## ERC721 and NFTs

In the early days of ENS, the ERC721 standard did not exist.
The original ETH Registrar formed the pre-cursor to the ERC721 standard.
As we witnessed the ERC721 being standardized, support for it was added to the ETH Registrar.

Today, users can interact with the ETH Registrar to transfer their name just like with any other ERC721 token.

## Registering a Name

Registering a name is a trustless process that takes place onchain (more on this below). Some open source frontends for registering names are the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains/), [ENS Fairy](https://ensfairy.xyz/), Rainbow Wallet.

The process of registering a `.eth` name uses a commit-reveal process.

### Commit-Reveal

The ETHRegistrarController, the highest level contract that users register names through, implements a commit reveal scheme to prevent frontrunning registrations.

We first call the `commit` function with an opaque bit of data (the `commitmenthash`), wait 60 seconds, and then call the `register` function. The `commit` function takes a commitment hash, which can be generated using the `makeCommitment` function. The commitment hash is opaque and revealed during the `register` function.

The commit-reveal process is to prevent a malicious actor from seeing your `register` transaction in the public mempool and frontrunning it.

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.makeCommitment(
    name string,
    owner address,
    duration uint256,
    secret bytes32,
    resolver address,
    data bytes[],
    reverseRecord bool,
    ownerControlledFuses uint16
)

// For example
makeCommitment(
    "myname", // "myname.eth" but only the label
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the name
    31536000, // 1 year (in seconds)
    0x1234..., // A randomly generated 32 byte secret you create
    0x1234..., // The address of the resolver you want to use
    [0x8b95dd71...], // Encoded function calls you want to pass to the resolver, like `setAddr()`
    false, // Whether or not to set the new name as your primary name
    0 // The NameWrapper fuses you want to set
);
```

Once you have calculated the commitment hash, submit the `commit` transaction.

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.commit(commitment bytes32)
```

After having committed, it is required to wait at least the `MIN_COMMITMENT_AGE` (60 seconds) before making the subsequent `register` transaction.

### Registering

Once you have made the onchain commitment and waited 60 seconds, you can register your name.
Registration takes in the same parameters as the `makeCommitment` function above.

Before initiating registration, ensure that:

- `available(label)` == `true`, where `label` is "name" in "name.eth"
- `duration` >= `MIN_REGISTRATION_DURATION`
- `commitments[commitment]` is between 1 min and 24 hrs old
- `msg.value` >= `rentPrice(name, duration)` + `5-10% (slippage)`

Because the rent price is paid in ETH but denominated in USD, callers are recommended to send slightly more than the value returned by `rentPrice` to avoid issues with fast price changes. A premium of 3-5% will likely be sufficient.
Any excess funds sent during registration are automatically returned to the caller.

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.register(
    name string,
    owner address,
    duration uint256,
    secret bytes32,
    resolver address,
    data bytes[],
    reverseRecord bool,
    ownerControlledFuses uint16
)

// For example
register(
    "myname", // "myname.eth" but only the label
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the name
    31536000, // 1 year (in seconds)
    0x1234..., // The same secret you used in the `commit` transaction
    0x1234..., // The address of the resolver you want to use
    [0x8b95dd71...], // Encoded function calls you want to pass to the resolver, like `setAddr()`
    false, // Whether or not to set the new name as your primary name
    0 // The NameWrapper fuses you want to set
);
```

## Renewing a Name

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.renew()
```

Any user can renew a domain, not just the owner. This means that if you want to ensure a name doesn't expire you can renew it for someone.

By allowing renewal for any arbitrary amount of time users can ensure their name will not expire.
As per the separation between registry and controller, even with upgraded controller your name will still be yours.
