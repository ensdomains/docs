# Building with AI

ENS provides tools and resources for developers building with large language models (LLMs) and AI assistants. Whether you're using AI to help write code, building agentic applications, or integrating ENS into AI-powered products, these resources will help.

## Plain Text Documentation

LLMs work best with plain text content that has fewer formatting tokens. ENS hosts machine-readable versions of this documentation following the emerging [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/).

| File                             | Description                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [/llms.txt](/llms.txt)           | Concise overview of ENS documentation with links |
| [/llms-full.txt](/llms-full.txt) | Complete documentation in plain text format      |

You can provide these URLs to AI assistants or include them in your RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipelines to give your AI tools up-to-date knowledge about ENS.

### Example Usage

When working with an AI assistant, you can reference these files directly:

```
Please read https://docs.ens.domains/llms.txt to learn about ENS,
then help me integrate ENS name resolution into my application.
```

## Context7 MCP

[Context7](https://context7.com) provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that gives your AI coding assistant access to up-to-date ENS documentation. Once installed, you can simply ask your AI to use Context7 when working on ENS integrations.

### Installation

Install the Context7 MCP in your preferred AI coding tool:

:::code-group

```bash [Claude Code]
claude mcp add context7 -- npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp
```

```json [Cursor (~/.cursor/mcp.json)]
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

```json [Windsurf]
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

:::

### Example Prompts

Once Context7 is connected, you can use prompts like:

```
Add ENS name resolution to this address input field. Use context7.
```

```
Show me how to fetch a user's avatar from their ENS name. Use context7 for ensdomains/docs.
```

```
Help me implement reverse resolution to show ENS names instead of addresses. Use context7.
```

The key is adding "use context7" to your prompt, which tells your AI assistant to fetch the latest ENS documentation before responding.

## AI Chat Assistant

Every page in this documentation includes an AI-powered chat assistant in the bottom right corner. Powered by [Cookbook](https://ai.cookbook.dev/), this assistant can:

- Answer questions about ENS concepts and implementation
- Help you navigate the documentation
- Provide code examples and explanations
- Assist with debugging ENS integrations

Click the chat icon in the bottom right corner of any page to get started.

## Tips for AI-Assisted Development

When building ENS integrations with AI assistance:

1. **Use the full docs** - For comprehensive context, use `/llms-full.txt` in your prompts
2. **Specify your stack** - Mention which library you're using ([viem](https://viem.sh), [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/), [ENSjs](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs)) for more relevant code examples
3. **Ensure ENSv2 readiness** - Point your AI to the [ENSv2 readiness guide](/web/ensv2-readiness) to make sure your integration is compatible
