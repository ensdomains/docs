# Deployments

:::note
This page contains information that is only relevant to developers who would
like to interact with the contract manually. Most libraries will handle this
for you.
:::

ENS is multichain (read more [here](/web/multichain)) and can be used in any application.
In addition to being able to query many address formats and record types, data can be stored [practically anywhere](/learn/ccip-read).
However, resolution needs to start somewhere, so the entrypoint for resolution is Ethereum Mainnet, alongside the most popular testnets.

## Deployments

Listed below you will find a list of latest deployments of registries, resolvers, and more.

### Mainnet

Interact with ENS on Ethereum Mainnet via [app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains).

<ContractDeployments chain="mainnet" />

### Sepolia

Interact with ENS on the Sepolia testnet via [sepolia.app.ens.domains](https://sepolia.app.ens.domains).

<ContractDeployments chain="sepolia" />

### Holesky

Interact with ENS on the Holesky testnet via [holesky.app.ens.domains](https://holesky.app.ens.domains).

<ContractDeployments chain="holesky" />

## But what about multichain?

The ENS Protocol can be used on/for any chain! If you are building a dApp and want to use ENS you might have to add a [Mainnet RPC to your Wagmi config](/web/libraries).
This allows tools like wagmi to access mainnet, and load ENS information!
