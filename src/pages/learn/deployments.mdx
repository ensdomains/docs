# Deployments

:::note
This page contains information that is only relevant to developers who would
like to interact with the contract manually. Most libraries will handle this
for you.

ENS is multichain (read more [here](/web/multichain)) and can be used in any application.
In addition to being able to query many address formats and record types, data can be stored [practically anywhere](/learn/ccip-read).
However, resolution needs to start somewhere, so the entrypoint for resolution is Ethereum Mainnet, alongside the most popular testnets.

## Deployments

Below you will find an abbreviated list of our latest contract deployments. The source of truth for ENS contract deployments is the [ensdomains/ens-contracts](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/staging/deployments) repository.

### Mainnet

Interact with ENS on Ethereum Mainnet via [app.ens.domains](https://app.ens.domains).

<ContractDeployments chain="mainnet" />

### Sepolia

Interact with ENS on the Sepolia testnet via [sepolia.app.ens.domains](https://sepolia.app.ens.domains).

<ContractDeployments chain="sepolia" />

### Holesky

:::warning
Holesky testnet support is being phased out. Please migrate your workflows to Sepolia.
:::
Interact with ENS on the Holesky testnet via [holesky.app.ens.domains](https://holesky.app.ens.domains).

<ContractDeployments chain="holesky" />

## But what about multichain?

While the core ENS protocol lives on Ethereum Mainnet, it can be used to resolve data for any chain!
