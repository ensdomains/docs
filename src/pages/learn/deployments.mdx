:::note
This page contains information that is only relevant to developers who would
like to interact with the contract manually. Most libraries will handle this
for you.

ENS is multichain (read more [here](/web/multichain)) and can be used in any application.
In addition to being able to query many address formats and record types, data can be stored [practically anywhere](/learn/ccip-read).
However, resolution needs to start somewhere, so the entrypoint for resolution is Ethereum Mainnet, alongside the most popular testnets.

## Deployments

Listed below you will find a list of latest deployments of registries, resolvers, and more.

### Mainnet

<ContractDeployments chain="mainnet" />

### Sepolia

<ContractDeployments chain="sepolia" />

### Holesky

<ContractDeployments chain="holesky" />

## But what about multichain?

The ENS Protocol can be used on/for any chain! If you are building a dApp and want to use ENS you might have to add a [Mainnet RPC to your Wagmi config](/web/libraries).
This allows tools like wagmi to access mainnet, and load ENS information!
