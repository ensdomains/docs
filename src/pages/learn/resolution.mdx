# Resolution [The ENS Resolution Process]

:::note
This document aims to provide a brief overview of how resolution works, to
read more about resolution checkout the [dedicated Resolution
Section](/resolution).
:::

One of the major parts of the ENS protocol is the resolution process. The Resolution process at its core is the process of converting a human-readable name to a machine-readable address.

Though there is a lot of smart contract magic under the hood, the ENS system consists of two main paths: [Forward Resolution](#forward-resolution), used to go from name to address (and load other extra data), and [Reverse Resolution](#reverse-resolution), used to go from address to name.

## Forward Resolution

Forwards resolution is the process of going **from name to address**. As well as to load the records associated to a name.
These records include but are not limited to **discord**, **twitter**, **github**, **email**, **timezone**, and more.

Implementing forwards resolution in a dApp can be as simple as using a single line of code!
To learn more about how to implement forwards resolution, check out the [Address Resolution](/web/resolution) documentation.

## Reverse Resolution

Reverse resolution is the process of going **from address to name**. This is a crucial part of the ENS system, as it allows for any address, to be resolved into a human readable name.
Instead of pages filled with addresses, you can now show the names of the people behind the addresses.

<Card className="flex items-center justify-center gap-2">
  <span className="font-medium">0x225...c3B5</span>
  <span>to</span>
  <EnsProfile name="nick.eth" hideAddress />
</Card>
