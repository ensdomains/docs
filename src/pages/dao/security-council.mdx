# ENS DAO Security Council

The ENS DAO Security Council is a 4-of-8 multi-sig with a limited mandate: to cancel malicious proposals that threaten the DAO, particularly those that would compromise the treasury. It was created to address vulnerabilities stemming from low voter participation relative to treasury size.

## Purpose and Powers

The security council is expected to act only in emergency, in the given following situations or similar cases:

- If a proposal goes against the [ENS Constitution](/dao/constitution)
- If a proposal is approved with malicious intent against the DAO longevity/sustainability
- If such [a] proposal is approved by any group of voters, but [they are] directly financially incentivised to vote against the DAO's interests to preserve their own financial stake
- If any approved proposal goes directly against the DAO for the sole benefit of an attacker

The council cannot propose, amend, or otherwise initiate governance actions.

## Time-Limited Authority

The Security Council's cancel authority is time-limited. Two years after deployment (at unix timestamp `1784919179`), any address may call `renounceTimelockRoleByExpiration()` to permanently disable the cancel role, promoting decentralisation over time.

## Relevant Proposals

The veto was first introduced in [Introducing veto.ensdao.eth](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/introducing-veto-ensdao-eth/19088), and approved via social proposal [EP 5.7](/dao/proposals/5.7). Additional discussion occured in [Enable the cancel role on the DAO](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/temp-check-enable-cancel-role-on-the-dao/19090). Member appointments were confirmed in social proposal [EP 5.10](/dao/proposals/5.10), and the Security Council was formally implemented in Executable [EP 5.13](/dao/proposals/5.13).
