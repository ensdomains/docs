# The ENS Token

:::info
ENS Airdropped tokens to anyone who held an ENS name on _October 31st, 2021_.
**THERE ARE NO PLANS FOR ANOTHER AIRDROP**. Please be weary of any notices of
airdrops as these could turn out fraudulent.

All major decisions of the ENS DAO governance rely on the ENS Governance Token, which was distributted to ENS owners in 2021. The token can be found at [token.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/token.ensdao.eth) on Ethereum Mainnet and is the only official governance token for ENS DAO.

The $ENS token allocation can be seen in the pie chart below.

## Can I recover tokens accidentally sent to the wrong address?

The answer depends on the address the token was sent to.

- If you accidentally sent the token to [token.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/token.ensdao.eth) or [wallet.ensdao.eth](https://etherscan.io/address/wallet.ensdao.eth), then it might be recoverable. Contact the [Meta-governance working group](/dao/stewards/) and explain the situation.

- If the tokens were sent to the null address (0x000...0000) or an address with a typo, then the tokens are unrecoverable and there's nothing that anyone can do.

- If the tokens were sent to an exchange or a third party, then contact that third party for help.
