## Abstract

This proposal executes funding requests for the Meta-Governance and Public Goods Working Groups for the April 2025 funding window as passed in [EP 6.6.1](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/6-6-1-social-april-funding-request-ens-meta-governance-working-group-term-6/20536) and [EP 6.6.2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/6-6-2-social-april-funding-request-ens-public-goods-working-group-term-6/20532). This bundled executable proposal follows the requirements set out in Rule 10.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/1.8/)).

## Proposal Components

### 1) [Meta-governance Funding Request \\[EP 6.6.1\\]](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/6-6-1-social-april-funding-request-ens-meta-governance-working-group-term-6/20536)

This amount will cover all expected expenses outlined in the social proposal while leaving a prudent reserve to ensure continuity if future funding is delayed.
