## Abstract

The Meta-Governance Working Group is responsible for providing governance oversight and supporting the management and operation of working groups through DAO tooling and governance initiatives as well as treasury management for the DAO.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

## Specification

This specification is the amount requested from the DAO treasury to the Metagov Multisig to fulfill anticipated budgetary needs through the next formal funding window in October 2025.

### Description of Initiatives/Pods

**Steward + Secretary Compensation**: Working Group Steward, Scribe, and Secretary compensation [as required by the steward working group rules](https://snapshot.box/#/s:ens.eth/proposal/0x88de13f2f088390262d1d5e7db9ddff5a74d0b878fedf590a0448c32692078ba).

**Governance**: Fee reimbursements and future initiatives related to reducing friction in the governance process. This includes 70k $ENS to be distributed to DAO contributor, Stewards, and Service Provider roles. In Term 6 this amount was increased to allow for launch of programs to reward delegators and delegates.

**Contract Audits**: Meta-governance maintains a balance to be used for contract audits. These audits are performed independently on contracts that are to be included in executable proposals if those contracts impact or affect any ENS protocol or ENS DAO contracts or processes.

**DAO Tooling**: Funding research and/or develpoment interfaces and dashboards to improve the governance process and increase transparency across the DAO.

**Discretionary**: Funds distributed at the discretion of stewards towards new initiatives + governance experiments.

## Conclusion

This funding request will allow the ENS Meta-Governance Working Group to continue its essential work in providing governance oversight, supporting the management and operation of working groups, and ensuring effective treasury management for the DAO. The requested funds will enable us to maintain our ongoing initiatives and develop new tools to enhance the governance process. We are grateful for the community's ongoing support and engagement, which is crucial to the success of the ENS DAO. The Meta-Governance Working Group remains committed to serving the ENS community and driving the long-term growth and sustainability of the ecosystem.
