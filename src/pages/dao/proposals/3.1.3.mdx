## Abstract

The Public Goods Working Group requests funding of 250,000 USDC and 50 ETH from the ENS DAO for Q1/Q2 2023.

This funding will be used to support projects and builders as provisioned by Article III of the ENS DAO Constitution, which provides for the funding of public goods in web3.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)). If this proposal is passed the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.
