## Abstract

We have identified that the legacy ENS multisig, which originally controlled ENS before the DAO was created, still has the 'controller' role on the ENS root. This means that a majority of multisig keyholders could create or replace any ENS TLD other than .eth. .eth is locked and cannot be modified by the DAO or anyone else.

In order to correct this oversight, this proposal revokes the legacy multisig's controller role from the root contract.

## Specification

Call `setController` on the ENS `Root` contract at `0xaB528d626EC275E3faD363fF1393A41F581c5897`, passing in the address of the legacy multisig, `0xCF60916b6CB4753f58533808fA610FcbD4098Ec0`.
