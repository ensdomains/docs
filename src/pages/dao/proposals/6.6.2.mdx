_This is an updated budget for this funding window to account for better treasury management at this time - a new funding request may be put forward in the October window which was not initially planned when scoping out this budget_

# Abstract

The Public Goods Working Group exists to fund initiatives that advance public goods funding within the wider ecosystem. We support builders, stewards, and community members working on public goods that are aligned with the values and goals of ENS.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules (EP 1.8). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all Working Groups requesting funding.

# Specification

This specification is the amount requested from the DAO treasury to the Public Goods Multisig to fulfill anticipated budgetary needs through the next formal funding window in October 2025.

| -------------------- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| ENS PG Main Multisig | 356k | 0   | 0    |

This amount will cover all expected expenses outlined below while leaving a small reserve to ensure continuity if future funding is delayed.

# Description of Initiatives

**1. Strategic Grants:** High-impact funding for initiatives aligned with the long-term vision of ENS and the broader public goods ecosystem. We are working on developing strategic initiatives focused on foundational infrastructure alongside our existing grants.

The pilot for Strategic Grants is our funding of the DRC. Since they are also receiving external matching funds for any contribution, our funding of 150,000 USDC equates to $300,000 in total funding dedicated to advancing decentralization advocacy and policy engagement.

Strategic Grants will be characterized by:

**Larger Funding Amounts:** Providing substantial support to initiatives that require more significant resources to succeed
**Internal Expertise Utilization:** Leveraging the expertise of our elected stewards rather than outsourcing key decision-making
**Focused Impact Areas:** Targeting underfunded yet critical areas such as developer tools, core dependencies, and infrastructure
**Measured Outcomes:** Establishing clear criteria for success and impact measurement from the outset

**2. Builder Grants:** Support for builders at all stages of their journey in building public goods. The platform will feature USDC payments as of next month so better accounting and higher amounts of funding can easily be distributed through the already tested and successful mechanism.

**3. Discretionary Buffer:** A 10% margin to provide flexibility for time-sensitive or emergent opportunities that align with the working groupâ€™s mandate. This may include hackathon sponsorship or event support.

**Conclusion**

This funding request will allow the Public Goods Working Group to continue its essential work in stewarding public goods funding. These resources will help us support a diverse set of builders, projects, and community-driven efforts, ensuring long-term sustainability and alignment with ENS values.

We are grateful for the ongoing support and engagement with our work.
