## Abstract

The ENS Public Goods Working Group requests funding of the below to **support operations until the March 2024 funding window**. The Working Group intends to refrain from requesting funds in the upcoming January 2024 Funding Window.

The Public Goods Working Group is responsible for supporting projects and builders as provisioned by Article III of the ENS DAO Constitution, which provides direction for the DAO to fund public goods that benefit the broader Ethereum and Web3 Ecosystems.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.
