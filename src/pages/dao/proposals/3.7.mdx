# [EP3.7] [Social] Approval of ENS Name Normalization Standard (ENSIP-15)

## Abstract

This is a vote to approve [ENSIP-15: Normalization Standard.](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard)

## Motivation

### EP3.7 Motivation

* Normalization isn't enforced on-chain.
* There is no code for the DAO to execute.
* Approval for ENSIP-15 should be confirmed through a social vote.

### ENSIP-15 Motivation

* Since [ENSIP-1](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance-docs/blob/8e2e6c98198dd31fd2e982987e286fd6ce540319/governance-proposals/ensip-1-ens.md) (originally [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137)) was finalized in 2016, Unicode has [evolved](https://unicode.org/history/publicationdates.html) from version 8.0.0 to 15.0.0 and incorporated many new characters, including complex emoji sequences.
* ENSIP-1 does not state the version of Unicode.
* ENSIP-1 implies but does not state an explicit flavor of IDNA processing.
* [UTS-46](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/) is insufficient to normalize emoji sequences. Correct emoji processing is only possible with [UTS-51](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/).
* Validation tests are needed to ensure implementation compliance.
* The success of ENS has encouraged spoofing via the following techniques:
  1. Insertion of zero-width characters.
  2. Using names which normalize differently between algorithms.
  3. Using names which appear differently between applications and devices.
  4. Substitution of confusable (look-alike) characters.
  5. Mixing incompatible scripts.

## Specification

* Replace [ENSIP-1 § Name Syntax](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-1-ens#name-syntax) "UTS-46 algorithm" with link to [ENSIP-15](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard).
* Agree to normalize names according to ENSIP-15 for a safer end-user experience.

  * Libraries implementing ENSIP-15:
    1. Javascript — [adraffy/ens-normalize](https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js)
    2. Javascript — [ensdomains/eth-ens-namehash](https://github.com/ensdomains/eth-ens-namehash)
    3. Python — [namehash/ens-normalize-python](https://github.com/namehash/ens-normalize-python)
  * Web Frameworks using ENSIP-15:
    1. Javascript — [ethers/ethers.io](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js/)
    2. Javascript — [web3/web3.js](https://github.com/web3/web3.js)
    3. Javascript — [wagmi-dev/viem](https://github.com/wagmi-dev/viem)
* Names visible to the end-user should be [**beautified**](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-15-normalization-standard#annex-beautification) for a more consistent appearance.
  * Example: These labels are the same:\
