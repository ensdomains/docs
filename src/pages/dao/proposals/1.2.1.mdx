## Summary

The removal of Brantly Millegan as Director of The ENS Foundation (the "Foundation Company.").

Adapted from the original [EP6](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep6-cancelled-see-ep-6-1-and-6-2) Proposal.

## Abstract

This social proposal puts forth a vote to enact the possible removal of Brantly Millegan as the Director of the Foundation Company.

This action is justifiable under [Clause 15 of the Articles of Association of The ENS Foundation paragraph titled 'Directors'](https://464911102-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2FVAbPWWNVJRvupIW5EOre%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-4b4ba71c3fe2a3146e9b1402d03ecb69d89c0913%2FM%26A%20-%20Incorp%20-%20The%20ENS%20Foundation%20-%2026%20October%202021.pdf?alt=media#page=9) which states that:

> The Council has the power, exercisable by notice to the Foundation Company, to appoint or remove one or more directors of the Foundation Company.

## Motivation

A timeline of events that led to this proposal has been posted by Community WG Stewards in another post [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-next-steps-re-brantly/10424/15) and quoted below:

> In May 2016, Brantly Millegan tweeted, "Homosexual acts are evil. Transgenderism doesn't exist. Abortion is murder. Contraception is a perversion. So is masturbation and porn."
>
> On February 5th, 2022, brantly.eth, well-known as a prominent representative of the ENS protocol, [defended these views in a publicly held Twitter space](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljrp0vjibawuufr/Brantly%20ENS.mp4?dl=0).
>
> Irrespective of one's personal beliefs, we, as ENS DAO Community Stewards, must set the example for inclusivity and must divide our community.
>
> Propagating rhetoric that is viewed as hateful and discriminatory is not conduct conducive to the role as a Community Steward. This conduct will not be tolerated despite one's contributions to the protocol.

Through this Social Proposal, the DAO shall decide whether Brantly Millegan is deemed capable, or otherwise, of continuing his role as the Director of the Foundation Company, and to appoint a suitable replacement if he is deemed incapable.

## Specification

The removal of Brantly Millegan's directorship of the Foundation Company will be defined by a simple "Yes" or "No" vote with the option to abstain.
