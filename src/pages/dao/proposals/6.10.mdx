## Abstract

This proposal executes funding requests for the Meta-Governance and Public Goods Working Groups for the April 2025 funding window as passed in [EP 6.6.1](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/6-6-1-social-april-funding-request-ens-meta-governance-working-group-term-6/20536) and [EP 6.6.2](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/6-6-2-social-april-funding-request-ens-public-goods-working-group-term-6/20532). This bundled executable proposal follows the requirements set out in Rule 10.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/1.8/)).

## Proposal Components

### 1) [Meta-governance Funding Request \[EP 6.6.1\]](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/6-6-1-social-april-funding-request-ens-meta-governance-working-group-term-6/20536)

| Destination                                                                                           | USDC    | ETH | $ENS    |

| [ENS Meta-Gov Main Multisig](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91c32893216dE3eA0a55ABb9851f581d4503d39b) | 589,000 | 0   | 100,000 |

This amount will cover all expected expenses outlined in the social proposal while leaving a prudent reserve to ensure continuity if future funding is delayed.

### 2) [Public Goods Funding Request \[EP 6.6.2\]](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/6-6-2-social-april-funding-request-ens-public-goods-working-group-term-6/20532)

The ENS Public Goods Working Group requests funding to support operations through the next formal funding window in October 2025.
