# [5.9] [Social] Funding Request: ENS Meta-Governance Working Group Term 5 (Q1/Q2)

## Abstract

In March 2024, The ENS Metagov funding request for Q1/Q2 failed to gain the support needed to pass.  
The ENS Meta-Governance Working Group is now using the June 2024 funding window to request the Q1/Q2 funding to cover operations until the next funding window in September 2024. 

The Meta-Governance Working Group is responsible for providing governance oversight and supporting the management and operation of working groups through DAO tooling and governance initiatives as well as treasury management for the DAO. 

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)) and further required by [this snapshot proposal in Nov. 2023 modifying steward rules.](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

### Description of Initiatives/Pods

- **Steward + Secretary Compensation**: Working Group Steward and Secretary compensation as required by [revised steward working group rules](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) and [totaling $294,000 USDC to cover the costs for all 9 stewards and supporting roles for a 6 month period](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-steward-compensation/18063).  
- **Governance**: Fee reimbursements and initiatives related to reducing friction in the governance process. This can also include $ENS distributed in order to lower barriers to the governance proposal process.  The $ENS distributions to stewards and service providers falls into this catagory.
- **DAO Tooling**: Developing interfaces and dashboards to improve the governance process and increase transparency across the DAO. An example of DAO tooling spend is our current engagement with Agora as they help build out an enhanced DAO proposal flow to streamline the proposal process.
- **Discretionary**: Funds distributed at the discretion of stewards towards new initiatives + governance experiments. In this cycle, we've consolidated the former DAO Sponsorship category into this discretionary category.


## Conclusion

This funding request will allow the ENS Meta-Governance Working Group to continue its essential work in providing governance oversight, supporting the management and operation of working groups, and ensuring effective treasury management for the DAO. The requested funds will enable us to maintain our ongoing initiatives and develop new tools to enhance the governance process. We are grateful for the community's ongoing support and engagement, which is crucial to the success of the ENS DAO. The Meta-Governance Working Group remains committed to serving the ENS community and driving the long-term growth and sustainability of the ecosystem.
