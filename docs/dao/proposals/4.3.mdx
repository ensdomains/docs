# [EP4.3] [Executable] Refund Invalid .eth Names

This proposal initiates a transfer of 117 ETH to the Meta-Governance Working Group to facilitate the refunding of .eth names invalidated by ENSIP-15, the latest ENS name normalization standard.

## Specification

ENSIP-15 introduced a new ENS name normalization standard, resulting in the invalidation of a set of .eth names. In order to address the impact on owners of these invalidated names, refund amounts have been determined based on the following factors:

1. Remaining registration fee or renewal fee
2. Gas fees paid to register the name
3. Any premium protocol fee paid to acquire the names

These factors together have been used to calculate the refund amounts. A total of 2,973 unique addresses will be refunded a total of approximately 115 ETH.

Note: The data is from June 18, 2023 when ENSIP-15 passed. The [distributions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JoLq8obUwFu_xGaXRMslAyX6nwR3njXqIc7I9sizTLU/edit?usp=sharing) and [code](https://github.com/ensdomains/normalise-refund) are both open source.

To facilitate the transfer of refunds to the affected addresses, this proposal suggests transferring the necessary ETH amount, including gas fees, to the Meta-Governance multisig. The multisig will then execute the refunds on behalf of the ENS DAO and return any leftover gas funds, if applicable.
