# [EP1.2.2] [Social] Election of a new Director of The ENS Foundation

_Note: This was previously numbered EP6.2._

### Abstract

This social proposal puts forth a vote for the election of a new Director of the ENS foundation.

This is a **contingent proposal** that will only be ratified if [\[EP6.1\] \[Social\] Removal of Brantly Millegan as Director of The ENS Foundation](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-6-1-social-removal-of-brantly-millegan-as-director-of-the-ens-foundation/11092) determines that Brantly Millegan shall be removed from the directorship of the Foundation Company.

**Contingency:** If majority "No" is voted on [\[EP6.1\] \[Social\] Removal of Brantly Millegan as Director of The ENS Foundation](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep-6-1-social-removal-of-brantly-millegan-as-director-of-the-ens-foundation/11092), this proposal shall be null and void.

### Motivation

By a vote of the council, Brantly Millegan was removed as a director of the Foundation Company., the DAO shall decide whether Brantly Millegan is deemed capable, or otherwise, of continuing his role as the Director of the Ethereum Foundation, and to appoint a suitable replacement if he is deems incapable.

A timeline of events that led to this proposal has been posted by Community WG Stewards in another post [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-next-steps-re-brantly/10424/15) and quoted below:

> In May 2016, Brantly Millegan tweeted that, “Homosexual acts are evil. Transgenderism doesn’t exist. Abortion is murder. Contraception is a perversion. So is masturbation and porn.”
>
> On February 5th, 2022, brantly.eth, well-known as a prominent representative of the ENS protocol, [defended these views in a publicly held Twitter space](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ljrp0vjibawuufr/Brantly%20ENS.mp4?dl=0).
>
> Irrespective of one’s personal beliefs, we, as ENS DAO Community Stewards, must set the example for inclusivity and must not divide our community.
>
> Propagating rhetoric that is viewed as hateful and discriminatory is not conduct conducive to the role as a Community Steward. This conduct will not be tolerated despite one’s contributions to the protocol.

The appointment of the incoming Director will be held by a [ranked choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked\_voting) Snapshot vote from a list of pre-determined nominees. Additionally, there shall be an option for voters to select "None of the above" or abstain from this vote.
