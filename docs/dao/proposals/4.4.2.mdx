## Abstract

The ENS Meta-Governance Working Group requests funding of the below to **support operations until the March 2024 funding window**. This means the Working Group will not be requesting funds in the January 2024 Funding Window.

The Meta-Governance Working Group is responsible for providing governance oversight and supporting the management and operation of working groups through DAO tooling and governance initiatives as well as treasury management for the DAO.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

## Expenditures

Meta-Gov sets aside funds to ensure coverage for critical mission initiatives. While we strive to estimate term expenditures accurately, the final spending depends on pending initiatives. We anticipate that Final Expenditures will not surpass the Expected Expenses allocated for the term.
