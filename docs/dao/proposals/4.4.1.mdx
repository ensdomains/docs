## Abstract

The ENS Ecosystem Working Group requests funding of 409,000 USDC to support operations until the March 2024 funding window. This is the only funding request of this term.

The ENS Ecosystem Working Group is responsible for growing and improving the ENS Ecosystem by funding builders and projects that are ENS-specific or ENS-centric.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

### Reserved for Initiatives

Ecosystem reserves amounts to make sure we can cover initiatives that are important. Reserving is not the same as spending it. For example, we are reserving 250k for the bug bounty program. The actual spend will depend on what, if any, bugs are discovered.

| Initiatives    | USDC | ETH |
| :------------- | ---: | --: |
| Grants         | 300k | 115 |
| Bug Bounty     | 250k |   0 |
| Hackathon      | 150k |  50 |
| Audit Support  | 100k |   0 |
| IRL            |  75k |   0 |
| Newsletter     |  25k |   0 |
| Reserved Total | 900k | 165 |

**Reconciliation**
| Initiatives|USDC|ETH|
|:----|----:|----:|
|Current Balance|741k| 249|
|Reserved|(900k)| (165)|
|Buffer|(250k)| (50)|
|Total|(409k)|34 |

As result, Ecosystem WG is requesting 409,000 in USDC and zero ETH. This request ensures that there are sufficient resources to meet the expected future needs of the working group.
