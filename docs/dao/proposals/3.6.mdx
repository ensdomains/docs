# [EP3.6] [Social] Election of new ENS Foundation director

## Abstract

This is a vote to elect a new director of the ENS Foundation.

## Motivation

Brantly Millegan has [communicated](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/resignation-from-the-ens-foundation-effective-upon-the-election-of-a-replacement/16676) that he would like to resign as a director of the ENS Foundation. Brantly's resignation will take effect following the appointment of a new director by the DAO.

The DAO may appoint a new director of the ENS Foundation pursuant to Article 15 of the Articles of Association of the ENS Foundation.

## Specification

The DAO will vote to appoint one new director of the ENS Foundation.

Two candidates are seeking election after successfully completing the requirements outlined in the ['Call for Nominees' post](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/call-for-nominees-ens-foundation-director/16858) on the ENS Governance forum.

The candidates seeking election are:

1. Sean Murray
2. Alex Van de Sande

The candidate with the highest number of votes above quorum will be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation following the completion of mandatory KYC checks.

### Voting

This vote is a single choice vote. You may vote for one of the following options:

1. Sean Murray
2. Alex Van de Sande
3. None of the above
4. Abstain

By voting for a named candidate, you are voting in favor of appointing that candidate as a director of the ENS Foundation.

## Candidates

### Sean Murray

**Twitter**: [@financeguy74](https://twitter.com/financeguy74) \
**Are you 18 years of age or older?** Yes \
**Are you a U.S citizen or permanent resident?** Yes \
**Do you live in the U.S or one of its territories?** Yes

**Why should you be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation?** \
I am capable of fulfilling the required duties but also beyond that I would use it as a platform to increase mainstream ENS adoption.

**How would you handle a request from the SEC for information about the ENS Foundation and/or the $ENS token?** \
This is an incomplete question because it does not specify who "you" is. If an SEC inquiry is addressed only to the Foundation itself, the correct answer is that the Foundation retain counsel and that counsel manage the inquiry. Should the definition of "you" be more broad, then any rational person should find my conditions stated below rational, reasonable, and necessary. They should be put in place regardless of who is chosen.

**Is there any other information you would like delegates to know about you or your nomination?** \
Yes, if by chance I am selected, my acceptance of the role is conditional on:

* The DAO authorizing the Foundation to set up D\&O insurance;
* The DAO authorizing the Foundation to compensate directors.

### Alex Van de Sande

**Twitter**: [@avsa](https://twitter.com/avsa) \
**Are you 18 years of age or older?** Yes \
**Are you a U.S citizen or permanent resident?** No \
**Do you live in the U.S or one of its territories?** No

**Why should you be appointed as a director of the ENS Foundation?** \
I won't lie: I believe this role is purely ceremonial and believe that as long as everything is working as intended, Directors should do nothing but rubberstamp what the DAO approves. But as a symbol, I do think it's important for the Directors not to be all from ENS Labs, nor for them to be in any jurisdiction that is not welcome to Crypto - and at this moment, the US is such jurisdiction.

So that's it, that's the whole of my pitch: I do not work for ENS labs, I do not respond to them, nor do I am subject to US jurisdiction. I also have been in this space for the last 10 years and you can expect me to be around in the next 10 years.

**How would you handle a request from the SEC for information about the ENS Foundation and/or the $ENS token?** \
I am not not subject to American laws, but that doesn't mean I intend to break any of them, as I still intend to keep the privilege of landing in US soil. I still believe the US to be a reasonable thriving democracy that is just right now a bit on the wrong side of the pendulum. I also believe that the ENS airdrop was a great precedent on how to do token distribution to the community: no "investor" ever received it in the airdrop, because there were no investors in ENS before the airdrop. All that received them were either involved in the community or the development.

If I ever received a request from the SEC of any other legal institutions from anywhere I would take the reasonable route: talk to my lawyer, open it with as much as possible with the community and, in an extreme case in which I believed I the requests would hurt ENS and I couldn't be open to talk about it, I would resign from the foundation.

**Is there any other information you would like delegates to know about you or your nomination?** \
I am not Dutch either, despite a lot of people seemingly believing it so.
