# [EP 3.4] [Executable] Fund the Endowment (first tranche)                                                                                                      |

## Abstract

First tranche to fund the Endowment with 16,000 ETH sent from [ENS DAO](https://etherscan.io/address/0xfe89cc7abb2c4183683ab71653c4cdc9b02d44b7) to the [ENS Endowment](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64) and an additional 150 ETH sent to the [Meta-Gov Pod](https://etherscan.io/address/0x91c32893216dE3eA0a55ABb9851f581d4503d39b) to account for karpatkey and Steakhouse monthly fees.

## Motivation

[Approximately one year ago](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/an-ens-endaoment/11756), the ENS DAO initiated a process to ensure the sustainability of ENS as a self-funded public good for the long term. The [RFP process](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep2-2-4-social-rfp-ens-endowment/14069) (EP2.2.4), on which [karpatkey, together with Steakhouse, made a proposal](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/updated-endaoment-proposal-karpatkey-steakhouse-financial/14799), resulted in the [selection of karpatkey](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-ep2-2-5-selection-of-an-ens-endowment-fund-manager/15188) (EP2.2.5).

For reference, the proposal submitted by karpatkey was for an initial size of \$52,000,000 USD (converted to 32,000 ETH for operational purposes as the Endowment will be founded in ETH and to account for the reduction of the pool according to [EP3.3](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ep3-3-executable-sell-eth-into-usdc/15906)). The proposal included performance fees of 10% above the investment's reference currency, with $ for $-related investments and ETH for ETH-related investments, as well as an annual fee of 0.5% based on the size of the endowment, payable entirely in ETH on a monthly basis.

Karpatkey engaged in discussions with the ENS community to seek feedback on strategies and the ramp-up process, both [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/social-endowment-initial-conditions-required-steps/15684) and [here](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-initiation/15952). Feedback was received regarding concerns about the required time to establish trust and the need to limit executive votes for funding. Karpatkey believes that a balanced approach, such as funding 50% on day one and the remaining 50% after six months, would be a suitable tradeoff for all parties. To address questions and concerns raised, a [FAQ](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/endowment-frequently-asked-questions-faq/16228) was provided.

In the meantime, karpatkey made progress on the setup of [the Endowment safe](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4F2083f5fBede34C2714aFfb3105539775f7FE64), which has been seeded to display target positions. The necessary [managing permissions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11xrliJIveXO6C6twYOrnGJ5QUW0Apr1LCcDY8hOfpuo/edit) have been defined and audits from [Ackee](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles/blob/main/packages/evm/docs/ZodiacModifierRolesJanuary2023abch.pdf) and [Sub 7](https://github.com/gnosis/zodiac-modifier-roles/blob/main/packages/evm/docs/ZodiacModifierRolesJanuary2023sub7.pdf) have been completed. On its part, Steakhouse has started work on providing open source [accounting and financial services](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xS4nXx1G0QCjFS-VdG5yVmVoMa5t1q9_dFZ9N4wGSJ8/edit?usp=sharing), as well as a [monitoring Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/steakhouse/ens-steakhouse), both of which are work in progress.

If the Endowment is funded through this first tranche, karpatkey will allocate the funds as follows:
