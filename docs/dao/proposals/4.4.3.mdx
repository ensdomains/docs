## Abstract

The ENS Public Goods Working Group requests funding of the below to **support operations until the March 2024 funding window**. The Working Group intends to refrain from requesting funds in the upcoming January 2024 Funding Window.

If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.
