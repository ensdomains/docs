## Expenditures

Meta-Gov sets aside funds to ensure coverage for mission-critical initiatives. While we strive to estimate term expenditures accurately, the final spending depends on pending initiatives. We anticipate that final expenditures will not surpass the expected expenses allocated for the term.

### Description of Initiatives/Pods

**Steward + Secretary Compensation**: Working Group Steward and Secretary compensation as required by [revised steard working group rules](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x26a5c8dec547837495707e70446d1e7cd874a91f75753c602998f6e70083a266) and [totaling $294,000 USDC](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-steward-compensation/18063).

**Governance**: Fee reimbursements and initiatives related to reducing friction in the governance process. This can also include $ENS distributed in order to lower barriers to the governance proposal process.

**DAO Tooling**: Developing interfaces and dashboards to improve the governance process and increase transparency across the DAO. An example of DAO tooling spend is our current engagement with Agora as they help build out an enhanced DAO proposal flow to streamline the proposal process.

**Discretionary**: Funds distributed at the discretion of stewards towards new initiatives + governance experiments. In this cycle, we've consolidated the former DAO Sponsorship category into this discretionary category.
 
## Conclusion

This funding request will allow the ENS Meta-Governance Working Group to continue its essential work in providing governance oversight, supporting the management and operation of working groups, and ensuring effective treasury management for the DAO. The requested funds will enable us to maintain our ongoing initiatives and develop new tools to enhance the governance process. We are grateful for the community's ongoing support and engagement, which is crucial to the success of the ENS DAO. The Meta-Governance Working Group remains committed to serving the ENS community and driving the long-term growth and sustainability of the ecosystem.
