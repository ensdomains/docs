#### 2. Elected Steward Compensation

Provide compensation for the three elected Community Stewards @limes , @spencecoin and @coltron.eth for the entire Q1/Q2 steward term.

| Description               | Compensation |  Months #  | Stewards # | Total USDC |
| ------------------------- | :----------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Base Compensation         | $1,000/month |     5.5    |      3     |   16,500   |
| Supplemental Compensation | $2,000/month |     5.5    |      -     |   11,000   |
| **Total**                 |              | **27,500** |            |            |

**Note:** _Supplemental compensation shall be distributed to stewards and contributors involved in running operations for the WG. The supplemental compensation will be used in situations where contributors or stewards perform duties beyond what is normally expected. The steward council determines how the supplemental compensation will be split between the stewards based on the contributions of each steward._

#### Considerations

Multiple parties will approve all funding disbursements using a multi-sig. This budget does not guarantee disbursement, specifically if services rendered to the DAO are incomplete or deemed unsatisfactory. If these situations arise, the working group will review them publicly at the weekly Community Steward Call.

Any funding not used will be re-allocated back to the treasury.
