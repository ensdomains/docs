# [EP5.2] [Executable] Commence Streams for Service Providers

This EP will initiate the Streams for Service Providers as selected on [EP4.9](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/4.9)

## Abstract

[EP 4.7](https://docs.ens.domains/dao/proposals/4.7) proposed the concept of Streams for service providers and set its budget at $3.6M per annum. EP4.9 selected the following Service providers and their annual budget:

|Service Provider Name| Annual Stream |
|---|---|
|ETH.LIMO|$500,000.00|
|NameHash Labs|$600,000.00|
|Resolverworks.eth|$700,000.00|
|Blockful|$300,000.00|
|Unruggable|$400,000.00|
|Wildcard Labs|$200,000.00|
|Ethereum Follow Protocol|$500,000.00|
|Namespace|$200,000.00|
|UNICORN.ETH|$200,000.00|

The Metagov Working Group has decided this will be implemented in the following manner:

1. Superfluid has been selected as the stream platform (details of which can be found on [this RFP](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/rfp-stream-platform-for-ens-service-providers/18448))
2. A new wallet, the "[Stream Management Pod](https://app.safe.global/settings/setup?safe=eth:0xB162Bf7A7fD64eF32b787719335d06B2780e31D1)" has been created as a Global.Safe (Gnosis Safe) wallet. It requires 3 out of 5 signatures to execute any transaction. Its members are the 3 Metagov Stewards, the secretary and the DAO Governor contract.
3. **This EP includes 5 Executable Transactions**, as follows:
   1. **APPROVE** Superfluid contracts to wrap one month worth of USDC streaming (300,000 USDC);
   2. **WRAP** one month worth of USDC streaming (300,000 USDC to USDCx);
   3. **START A STREAM** to the Stream Management Pod of 0.114155251141552512 USDC per second [1];
   1. **APPROVE** AutoWrap [2] contract to wrap an additional 5.1M USDC (this, added to the already wrapped 300k, should be enough to cover 18 months of the stream, after that a new EP will be required to keep the stream running);
   1. **ENABLE AUTO-WRAP** to keep wrapping USDC to USDCx on a monthly basis (lower limit 200,000, upper limit 500,000).
4. Meanwhile the Stewards are reaching out to all representatives of the stream providers. Alex Urbelis, the general Counsel for ENS Labs, has drafted a service provider agreement and is acquiring the services of Urbelis to run a basic KYC and Sanctions protection. All Service Providers will be required to go through this process before receiving their first stream.
5. On February 1st Stream Management Pod will start  creating individual streams to the Organizations who have completed the steps outlined in bullet #4. Because of Superfluid unique no-upfront-capital-lockup streams, it means that when all of 9 Service Providers Streams start, the Stream Management Pod will be forwarding 100% of the money it  receives directly into the Service Providers.

### Notes

[1]: USDC has a precision of 6 decimal places, but SuperUSDC has a precision of 18 decimals. The value of 0.114155251141552512 per second corresponds to approximately 9863.01 USDC per day and in 3,600,000.000000000018432 USDC per year in a non-leap year. In leap years (such as the current one) it will mean an extra $9.8K is paid in the 29th of February. 

[2]: [Autowrapper](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1D65c6d3AD39d454Ea8F682c49aE7744706eA96d#code) is a [series](https://etherscan.io/address/0x30aE282CF477E2eF28B14d0125aCEAd57Fe1d7a1#code) of [contracts](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1D65c6d3AD39d454Ea8F682c49aE7744706eA96d#code) developed by superfluid. When pinged (and anyone would be able to ping it), if the amount of tokens that the DAO has wrapped is below the lower limit, it will automatically wrap new tokens in order to keep the stream running. The goal is to reduce smart contract risk. If Superfluid is somehow hacked, ENS will not lose more than the upper limit set here (about 50 days worth of funds). If both Superfluid AND the autowrapper are hacked at the same time, ENS cannot lose more than the maximum USDC allowance (18 months worth of funds).

[3]: Any capital that remains in the pod (due to the difference between the day this EP is executed and the day the last Service Provider stream is active) will be still considered under the DAO's ownership and will be used only as a buffer (if autowrapper fails, we will have some weeks to resolve it without interrupting payments) and to solve any logistical issues with service providers. It will NOT count towards Metagov's budget nor it will it be used to any other purpose than the service provider management.

All contracts have verifiable code. You can use tools such as the [Calldata decoder](https://tools.deth.net/calldata-decoder) to verify the correctness of the calldata and etherscan to look deeper into them. You can also *simulate the transactions yourself* using [this repo](https://github.com/d10r/ens-streams).

The terms for the createWrapSchedule are the address of the superToken (super-usdc), the address of the Strategy contract, the address of the base token (USDC), the expiry (set to the far future), lowerLimit and upperLimit. These last two are set in seconds and mean that if, when the autowrapper is pinged, the stream has less than 21 days in it's runway, then it will automatically wrap 50 days worth of funds.
