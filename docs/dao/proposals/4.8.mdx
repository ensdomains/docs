## Abstract

The intent of this proposal is to modify the working group guidelines to enhance the DAO's ability to attract and retain talent.

## Motivation

By increasing the term length, we aim to enable potential stewards to allocate more time to the DAO and to establish a transparent and predictable compensation structure for the delegates and token community.

### Proposed changes

#### Regarding term changes

These amendments are designed to extend the stewardship term, allowing candidates to commit more substantially to the DAO and benefit from a more stable financial prospect.

There are numerous small textual changes that change the two terms into a single one.

**Current:**

> 3.2. Stewards will be elected to serve within working groups for a set period of time (hereafter known as a 'Term' or 'Terms').
>
> 3.3. There are two Terms each calendar year:
>
> 1. The first Term commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the second Term ('First Term'); and
> 2. The second Term commences at 9am UTC on July 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the First Term of the following year ('Second Term').

**Proposed:**

> 3.2. Stewards will be elected to serve within working groups for a set period of one calendar year (hereafter known as a 'Term').
>
> 3.3. The Term for Stewards commences at 9am UTC on January 1 each year and ends immediately prior to the commencement of the Term of the following year.

Some minor changes also occur in sections 4 and 5 just to the same effect. [See the full diff below](https://github.com/ensdomains/governance-docs/pull/44/files).

#### Regarding changes to fair compensation guidelines

The aim here is to bolster the transparency surrounding compensation practices, benefiting voters and delegates and enhancing the DAO's capacity to attract and maintain skilled contributors. These are proposed amendments to section 11 (compensation for stewards)

**Proposed Addition:**

> 10.4. The Meta-Governance working group are responsible for defining standards for fair compensation ('Compensation Guidelines').
>
> 10.5. The Compensation Guidelines shall be defined prior to the Nomination Window for each term and can only take effect for the following term. Summary

The proposed changes intend to make Steward compensation more predictable and transparent, which serves the dual purpose of attracting more talent to the space as well as being fully transparent towards the electors.

## Voting

The vote is an approval voting meaning you need to vote to approve or reject each individual change. Changes will only take effect if the vote for approval on each section is higher than the rejection
