## Proposal Components

### 1) [Meta-governance Funding Request [EP 5.17.1]](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/5-17-1-social-funding-request-ens-meta-governance-working-group-term-5-oct-window/19677)

The Meta-governance Working Group requests funding to fulfill anticipated budgetary needs through the next formal funding window in April 2025.

| Destination                                                                                           |  USDC   | ETH |  $ENS  |

This amount will cover all expected expenses (including the ENS required for vesting on 5.19 and 5.21) while maintaining a 100,000 USDC prudent reserve to ensure continuity if future funding is delayed.

### 2) [Ecosystem Funding Request [EP 5.17.2]](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/5-17-2-social-funding-request-ens-ecosystem-working-group/19678)

The ENS Ecosystem Working Group requests funding to support operations through April 2025. This is the only funding request of Term 5. The working group is responsible for growing and improving the ENS Ecosystem by funding builders and projects that are ENS-specific or ENS-centric.

### 3) [Public Goods Funding Request [EP 5.17.3]](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/5-17-3-social-funding-request-ens-public-goods-working-group/19679)

The ENS Public Goods Working Group requests funding to support operations through the next funding window in April 2025. The funds requested extend current needs through to next term to ensure that next season's stewards have available funding before the next funding window.

| Destination                                                                                           |  USDC   | ETH | $ENS |
