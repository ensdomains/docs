# [5.17.2] [Social] Funding Request: ENS Ecosystem Working Group

## Abstract

The ENS Ecosystem Working Group requests funding of 836,000 USDC to support operations through April 2025. This is the only funding request of Term 5.

The ENS Ecosystem Working Group is responsible for growing and improving the ENS Ecosystem by funding builders and projects that are ENS-specific or ENS-centric.

This social proposal is submitted to satisfy the requirements set out in Rule 10.1.1 of the Working Group Rules ([EP 1.8](https://docs.ens.domains/v/governance/governance-proposals/term-1/ep12-working-group-rules)). If this proposal is passed, the funding request will be included in a collective executable proposal put forward by all three Working Groups.

## Description

### ENS Ecosystem Multisig Balances - As of October 4, 2023

The ENS Ecosystem Working Group multisigs:

### Reserved for Initiatives

Ecosystem reserves amounts to make sure we can cover initiatives that are important. Reserving is not the same as spending it. For example, we are reserving 100k for the bug bounty program. The actual spend will depend on what, if any, bugs are discovered.

| Initiatives     |     USDC |    ETH |
| :-------------- | -------: | -----: |
| Hackathon       |     300k |      - |

|Current Balance|129k| 91.5|

|Total|**(836k)**|**-** |

Ecosystem WG is requesting 836,000 in USDC and zero ETH. This request ensures that there are sufficient resources to meet the expected future needs of the ecosystem working group. Buffer is an additional reserve to cover unforeseen expenses or opportunities.
