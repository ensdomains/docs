This proposal will execute the funding specification according to [EP 5.9](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x66d355555c24ed0d2fed0aee89e4fe009e2925c84144c4edc707d33e7c19e554), as amended by [EP 5.8](https://snapshot.org/#/ens.eth/proposal/0x1f328fd1fda5f3cabfdace3e521403def7ad41b0b0582e27334c135cd23c511d).
