# The ENS Token {{ title: "The ENS Token" }}

<Note>ENS Airdropped tokens to anyone who held an ENS name on _October 31st, 2021_. **THERE ARE NO PLANS FOR ANOTHER AIRDROP**. Please be weary of any notices of airdrops as these could turn out fraudulent.</Note>

All major decisions of the ENS DAO governance rely on the ENS Governance Token, which was distributted to ENS owners in 2021. The token address is at token.ensdao.eth (0xC18360217D8F7Ab5e7c516566761Ea12Ce7F9D72) on ethereum Mainnet and is the only official governance token for the DAO.

## Can I recover tokens accidentally sent to the wrong address?

The answer depends on the address the token was sent to. If you accidentally sent the token to the token contract address listed above (0xC1836021..) or the wallet.ensdao.eth address (0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7) then the tokens might be recoverable. Contact the [Meta-governance working group](/dao/stewards/) at the [ENS Forum](https://discuss.ens.domains) and explain the situation. Tokens can only be sent back to the address they were sent from, so if it was sent from an exchange, contact your exchange support to make sure the address can receive tokens.

If the tokens were sent to the null address (0x000..) or an address with a typo, then the tokens are unrecoverable and there's nothing that anyone can do. If the tokens were sent to an exchange or a third party, then contact that third party for help.
