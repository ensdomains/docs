# Investment Policy Statement (IPS) for ENS Endowment Fund

## Introduction
This Investment Policy Statement (“IPS”) is intended to outline the principles and guidelines for the effective management of the ENS Endowment Fund (the “Endowment”). By establishing a clear understanding within the DAO regarding the purpose, constraints, and governance mechanisms for the Endowment, the DAO will be able to:

- **Plan for appropriate asset allocation and implementation of its Endowment (‘investment strategies’).**
- **Plan for resource allocation of the DAO (‘financial planning’).**
- **Establish responsibility and accountability of all involved parties (‘accountability’).**

## Background

### History of ENS
Founded in 2017, Ethereum Name Service (“ENS”) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. ENS maps human-readable names to machine-readable identifiers, such as Ethereum addresses, cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, metadata, and more. Further details can be found in its [Technical Documentation](https://docs.ens.domains).

### Purpose of ENS
As outlined in the ENS DAO Constitution, ENS focuses on building a decentralized public good (ENS domains). Financially, the Constitution states that any income generated by the ENS treasury should prioritize ensuring the long-term viability of ENS and funding ongoing development and improvements of the ENS system.

## Purpose of Investment Policy Statement
This IPS, developed by ENS DAO and Karpatkey, aims to:

- Define and assign responsibilities of all involved parties.
- Establish clear investment goals and objectives for Endowment assets.
- Provide guidance and limitations for the Endowment Manager.
- Set a basis for evaluating the performance of the Endowment Manager.
- Ensure prudent standards for managing Endowment assets.

The IPS outlines a philosophy and framework to guide Endowment management toward desired results, balancing specificity with flexibility.
