# ETH Registrar

The ETH Registrar is a special registrar. It allows for trustless on-chain name registration and is in charge of the ".eth" TLD.

<DNSGrid />

## BaseRegistrar vs Controller

The ETH Registrar is split into two contracts. The [BaseRegistrar](#todo) and the [ETHRegistrarController](#todo).
The BaseRegistrar is responsible for name ownership, transfers, etc (ownership related),
while the Controller is responsible for registration & renewal (pricing related).
This separation is done to reduce the attack surface of the registrar, and provides users with the guarantees of continued ownership of a name so long as the registrar is in place.

### Controllers

The [ETHRegistrarController](#todo) is the main controller for the ETH Registrar, and provides a straightforward registration and renewal mechanism.

## Pricing Structure

The ETH Registrar charges a fee for registration.
This fee is paid in ETH and is set to prevent spamming the registrar.
Any protocol fees are sent to the ENS Treasury.

### Pricing Oracle

Initially, a single pricing oracle was deployed, the [StablePriceOracle](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/ethregistrar/StablePriceOracle.sol).
This contract has owner-set prices for each name length (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more).
Users do not have to interact with this oracle directly, as the controller provides functionality to determine the pricing for a registration or renewal.

### 3, 4, and 5 Letter Names

The ETH Registrar has special pricing for 3, 4, and 5 (and more) letter names. At the time of writing, a `5+` letter `.eth` will cost you `5 USD` per year.
A `4` letter `160 USD` per year, and a `3` letter `640 USD` per year.
This pricing structure is done to promote market diversity as there are an exponentially less amount of names the shorter they become.
The minimum length of a name is 3 characters.

| Name Length | Price (USD) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 5+          | 5           |
| 4           | 160         |
| 3           | 640         |

### Premium & Auctions

In addition to length-based pricing the ETH Registrar also has a premium pricing structure.
90 days after a name expires (aka after the grace period), the name will go into a Temporary Premium Auction.
The Auction is a 21 day dutch auction, meaning that the price starts high (~100 Million USD) and exponentially decrease till it hits 0 or a bid goes through.

This is done to prevent sniping of names, and ensures the name goes to the highest bidder fairly.

You can read more about the temporary premium in [this article](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7900612-temporary-premium).

### Where does the money go?

Upon registration funds are sent to the ETHRegistrarController. The controller then sends the funds to the ENS Treasury (anyone can call the `withdraw` method to trigger this).
Income from the ETH Registrar is used to fund the development of ENS, its ecosystem, and other public goods.

Read more about our spending in [Article III of the Constitution](/dao/constitution#iii-income-funds-ens-and-other-public-goods).

## ERC721 and NFTs

In the early days of ENS, the ERC721 standard did not exist.
The original ETH Registrar formed the pre-cursor to the ERC721 standard.
As we witnessed the ERC721 being standardized support for it was added to the ETH Registrar.

Today, users can interact with the ETH Registrar to transfer their name just like with any other ERC721 token.

## Registering a Name

To register a name you can use the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app/), [ENS Fairy](https://ensfairy.xyz/), your favourite mobile wallet (if supported), or any other frontend you like.
If you would like to register a name through a smart contract, or your own interface, you can use the following functions.

For the process of `.eth` name registration the ETH Registrar uses a two transaction commit reveal process.

    <div className="text-center flex flex-col items-center">
        <Icons.FiHash className="text-2xl" />

    </div> 
    <div className="text-center flex flex-col items-center">
        <Icons.FiClock className="text-2xl" />
        <span>Wait</span>
    </div>

        <Icons.FiBookOpen className="text-2xl" />
        <span>Reveal</span>
    </div>
</div>

### Commit Reveal

The ETHRegistrarController implements a commit reveal scheme to prevent frontrunning.
The way it works is that during the registration process we first call the `commit` function with an opaque bit of data (the `commitmenthash`).
Wait a few blocks and then call the `register` function.

The `commit` function takes a commitment hash, which can be generated using the `makeCommitment` function. The commitment hash is opaque and revealed during the `register` function.

The commit reveal process ensures no eavesdropping third-party is able to register your name before you can.

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.makeCommitment(name string, owner address, duration uint256, secret bytes32, resolver address, data bytes[], reverseRecord bool, ownerControlledFuses uint16)

// For example
makeCommitment(
    "myname", // "myname.eth" but only the label
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the name
    31536000, // 1 year (in seconds)
    0x1234..., // A secret that you have generated (32 bytes)
    0x1234..., // The address of the resolver you want to use
    [],
    false, // Set as primary name?
    0
);
```

Once you have calculated the commitment hash you can call the `commit` function.


```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.commit(commitment bytes32)
```

Note this does require an on-chain transaction.
After having committed it is recommended to wait at least the `MIN_COMMITMENT_AGE` (~60 seconds) before registering.

### Registering

Once you have committed you can register your name.
Registration takes in the same parameters as the `makeCommitment` function, but this time is in the form of a transaction.

Before initiating registration ensure that:

-   `available(name)` == true
-   `duration` >= `MIN_REGISTRATION_DURATION`
-   `commitments[commitment]` is between 1 min and 24 hrs old
-   `msg.value` >= `rentPrice(name, duration)` + `5-10% (slippage)`

Because the rent price may vary over time, callers are recommended to send slightly more than the value returned by `rentPrice`, a premium of 5-10% will likely be sufficient.
Any excess funds sent during registration are automatically returned to the caller.

```solidity
ETHRegistrarController.register(name string, owner address, duration uint256, secret bytes32, resolver address, data bytes[], reverseRecord bool, ownerControlledFuses uint16)

// For example
register(
    "myname", // "myname.eth" but only the label
    0x1234..., // The address you want to own the name
    31536000, // 1 year (in seconds)
    0x1234..., // A secret that you have generated (32 bytes)
    0x1234..., // The address of the resolver you want to use
    [],
    false, // Set as primary name?
    0
);
```

If you would like to try registering a name live on a testnet you can use the live demo below.

<LiveDemo id="ethregistry" />

## Renewing a Name

```
ETHRegistrarController.renew()
```

Any user can renew a domain, not just the owner. This means that if you want to ensure a name doesn't expire you can renew it for someone.

By allowing renewal for any arbitrary amount of time users can ensure their name will not expire.
As per the separation between registry and controller, even with upgraded controller your name will still be yours.
