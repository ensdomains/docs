# Reverse Registrar

Reverse resolution in ENS - the process of mapping from an Ethereum address (eg, 0x1234...) to an ENS name - is handled using a special namespace, .addr.reverse. A special-purpose registrar controls this namespace and allocates subdomains to any caller based on their address. The reverse registrar is specified in EIP 181.

For example, the account `0x314159265dd8dbb310642f98f50c066173c1259b` can claim `314159265dd8dbb310642f98f50c066173c1259b.addr.reverse`.
After doing so, it can configure a resolver and expose metadata, such as a canonical ENS name for this address.

The reverse registrar provides functions to `claim` a reverse record,
as well as a convenience function (`setName`) to configure the record as it's most commonly used, as a way of specifying a canonical name for an address.

## Lookup Primary Name

If you are interested in [querying the primary name for an address](/web/reverse) you can checkout the web section.

## Set Primary Name

```solidity
function setName(string memory name) public returns (bytes32)
```

Configures the caller's reverse ENS record to point to the provided `name`.

This convenience function streamlines the process of setting up a reverse record for the common case where a user only wants to configure a reverse name and nothing else. It performs the following steps:

1. Sets the reverse record for the caller to be owned by the ReverseRegistrar.
2. Sets the reverse record for the caller to have `defaultResolver` as its resolver.
3. Sets the `name()` field in the `defaultResolver` for the caller's reverse record to `name`.

In short, after calling this, a user has a fully configured reverse record claiming the provided name as that account's canonical name.

Users wanting more flexibility will need to use `claim` or `claimWithResolver` and configure records manually on their chosen resolver contract.

## Multichain Considerations

The current infrastructure for primary names across multiple chains is being worked on.

## Other Functions

### Claim Address

```solidity
function claim(address owner) public returns (bytes32);
```

Claims the caller's address in the reverse registrar, assigning ownership of the reverse record to `owner`. Equivalent to calling `claimWithResolver(owner, 0)`.

```solidity
function claimWithResolver(address owner, address resolver) public returns (bytes32)
```

Claims the caller's address in the reverse registrar, assigning `ownership` of the reverse record to owner. If `resolver` is nonzero, also updates the record's resolver.

After calling this function:

- The reverse record for the caller (1234....addr.reverse) is owned by `owner`.
- If `resolver` is nonzero, the reverse record for the caller has its resolver set to `resolver`; otherwise it is left unchanged.

### Get Default Resolver

```solidity
Resolver public defaultResolver;
```

Returns the address of the resolver contract that the `ReverseRegistrar` uses for `setName`.
