# Name Processing

When interacting with the ENS protocol smart-contracts directly it is important to note that names are not stored in their human readable format.
In fact there are a few steps a name undergoes before it can be used by a smart-contract.

When building a dApp most of the time you don't have to worry about name processing, as most [libraries](/web/libraries) will handle this for you.

## Name Normalization {{ title: "Normalization", id: "normalize" }}

Normalization is the process of canonicalizing a name before running it through the [Namehash](#namehash) algorithm. It is important to always normalize all input, because even one little difference (like a capital vs lowercase character) will cause the namehash to be completely different.

For example, `NaMe.EtH` normalizes to `name.eth`. This ensures that the correct Registry node is used, no matter how the user types in the name.

ENS names are validated and normalized using the [ENSIP-15](/ensip/15) normalization algorithm.

Previously, [UTS-46](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/) was used, but that is insufficient for emoji sequences. Correct emoji processing is only possible with [UTS-51](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/). The [ENSIP-15](/ensip/15) normalization algorithm draws from those older Unicode standards, but also adds many other validation rules to prevent common spoofing techniques like inserting zero-width characters, or using confusable (look-alike) characters. See here for additional discussion on this: [Homogylphs](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7901658-homoglyphs)

A standard implementation of the algorithm is available here: https://github.com/adraffy/ens-normalize.js. This library is also [included in ENSjs](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs-v3/blob/main/packages/ensjs/src/utils/normalise.ts#L27).

To normalize a name, simply call `ens_normalize`:

```js
import {ens_normalize} from '@adraffy/ens-normalize'; // or require()
// npm i @adraffy/ens-normalize
// browser: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@adraffy/ens-normalize@latest/dist/index.min.mjs (or .cjs)

// *** ALL errors thrown by this library are safe to print ***
// - characters are shown as {HEX} if should_escape()
// - potentially different bidi directions inside "quotes"
// - 200E is used near "quotes" to prevent spillover
// - an "error type" can be extracted by slicing up to the first (:)
// - labels are middle-truncated with ellipsis (‚Ä¶) at 63 cps

// string -> string
// throws on invalid names
// output ready for namehash
let normalized = ens_normalize('RaFFYüö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.eTh');
// => "raffyüö¥‚Äç‚ôÇ.eth"

// note: does not enforce .eth registrar 3-character minimum
```

If the name was not able to be normalized, then that method will throw a descriptive error. A name is valid if it is able to be normalized.

## Namehash {{ title: "Namehash", id: "namehash" }}

<Note>
    You **MUST** [normalize](#normalize) a name before you attempt to create a namehash! If you don't, then the hash you get may be incorrect.

    Some libraries like [ensjs](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs-v3) will automatically do this for you.
</Note>

In order for us to interface with our nice readable names there needs to be a way we communicate them to smart-contracts.
ENS stores names in a uint256 encoded format we call a "namehash". This is done to optimize for gas, performance, and more.

### Code Examples

<CodeGroup>

```jsx {{ title: "ensjs-v3" }}
// https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs-v3

import { namehash } from '@ensdomains/ensjs/utils';

const node = namehash('name.eth');
```

```jsx {{ title: "ens-namehash-py" }}
// https://github.com/ConsenSysMesh/ens-namehash-py

from namehash import namehash

node = namehash('name.eth')
```

```rust {{ title: "namehash-rust" }}
// https://github.com/InstateDev/namehash-rust

fn main() {
  let node = &namehash("name.eth");
  let s = hex::encode(&node);
}
```

### Algorithm

The specification for the namehash algorithm is here: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137#namehash-algorithm

It's a recursive algorithm that works its way down until you hit the root domain. For `ens.eth`, the algorithm works like so:

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr><td>`namehash('ens.eth')` = `keccak256(namehash('eth') + labelhash('ens'))`</td></tr>
        <tr><td>`namehash('eth')` = `keccak256(namehash('') + labelhash('eth'))`</td></tr>
        <tr><td>`namehash('')` = `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`</td></tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

That last line is a special case: The namehash for an empty string (representing the root domain) is 32 null bytes.

If you plug everything in above, you'll end up with the final namehash value:

* `namehash('')` =
    * `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
* `labelhash('eth')` =
    * `keccak256('eth')` = 
    * `0x4f5b812789fc606be1b3b16908db13fc7a9adf7ca72641f84d75b47069d3d7f0`
* `namehash('eth')` =
    * `keccak256(namehash('') + labelhash('eth'))` =
    * `keccak256(0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004f5b812789fc606be1b3b16908db13fc7a9adf7ca72641f84d75b47069d3d7f0)` =
    * `0x93cdeb708b7545dc668eb9280176169d1c33cfd8ed6f04690a0bcc88a93fc4ae`
* `labelhash('ens')` =
    * `keccak256('ens')` =
    * `0x5cee339e13375638553bdf5a6e36ba80fb9f6a4f0783680884d92b558aa471da`
* `namehash('ens.eth')` =
    * `keccak256(namehash('eth') + labelhash('ens'))` =
    * `keccak256(0x93cdeb708b7545dc668eb9280176169d1c33cfd8ed6f04690a0bcc88a93fc4ae5cee339e13375638553bdf5a6e36ba80fb9f6a4f0783680884d92b558aa471da)` =
    * **`0x4e34d3a81dc3a20f71bbdf2160492ddaa17ee7e5523757d47153379c13cb46df`**

### Reverse Nodes {{ title: "Reverse Nodes", id: "reverse-nodes" }}

The [Reverse Node](/terminology#reverse-node) is a node in the Registry that can be claimed for any Ethereum account. The name this node represents is `[addr].addr.reverse`, where `[addr]` is the Ethereum public address (lowercase, without the "0x"). These reverse nodes are typically used to set a [Primary Name](#primary-name) for an account.

To generate the namehash for a reverse node:

* Take the input address and:
  * Remove the "0x" at the beginning
  * Convert all characters to lowercase
* Add `.addr.reverse` to the end
* Run this result through the namehash algorithm

For example, for address `0x481f50a5BdcCC0bc4322C4dca04301433dED50f0`, the name for the reverse node is:
* `481f50a5bdccc0bc4322c4dca04301433ded50f0.addr.reverse`

And the resulting namehash for the reverse node is:
* `0x58354ffdde6ac279f3a058aafbeeb14059bcb323a248fb338ee41f95fa544c86`

## Labelhash {{ title: "Labelhash", id: "labelhash" }}

<Note>
    You **MUST** [normalize](#normalize) a name before you attempt to create a labelhash! If you don't, then the hash you get may be incorrect.
</Note>

The labelhash is just the [Keccak-256](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) output for a particular label.

Labelhashes are used to construct [namehashes](#namehash), and often times a labelhash (rather than the raw label) will be the required input for various contract methods.

```js
// https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-sha3
const labelhash = '0x' + require('js-sha3').keccak_256('name')
```

## DNS Encoding {{ title: "DNS Encoding", id: "dns" }}

<Note>
    You **MUST** [normalize](#normalize) a name before you DNS-encode it! If you don't, then when you pass those DNS-encoded bytes into a contract method, incorrect namehashes/labelhashes may be derived.
</Note>

This is a binary format for domain names, which encodes the length of each label along with the label itself. It is used by some of the ENS contracts, such as when wrapping a subname or DNS name using the Name Wrapper.

To DNS-encode a name, first split the name into labels (delimited by `.`). Then for each label from left-to-right:

* One byte to denote the length of the label
* The UTF-8 encoded bytes for the label
* If this is the last label, then one final NUL (`0x00`) byte.

For example, to DNS-encode `my.name.eth`:

* `0x02` (length of the label "my")
* `0x6D79` (UTF-8 encoded bytes of "my")
* `0x04` (length of the label "name")
* `0x6E616D65` (UTF-8 encoded bytes of "name")
* `0x03` (length of the label "eth")
* `0x657468` (UTF-8 encoded bytes of "eth")
* `0x00` (end of name marker)

Final result: `0x026d79046e616d650365746800`

```js
// https://npmjs.com/package/dns-packet
const dnsEncodedBytes = require('dns-packet').name.encode('name.eth');
const dnsEncodedHexStr = '0x' + require('dns-packet').name.encode('name.eth').toString('hex');
// => 0x046e616d650365746800
```

<Note>
    Since the length of each label is stored in a single byte, that means that with this DNS-encoding scheme, each label is limited to being 255 UTF-8 encoded bytes in length. Because of this, names with longer labels cannot be wrapped in the [Name Wrapper](/wrapper/overview), as that contract uses the DNS-encoded name.
