# Public Resolver

{/* <WIP /> */}

The public resolver is a general-purpose ENS resolver that is suitable for most user needs. It permits the owner of a name to update their records, includes permissions, and stores its data on layer-1 ethereum.

Most ENS names registered through the ENS Manager will use the latest version of the public resolver by default.
Names that resolve to a supported public resolver are editable from within the ENS Manager.

## Features

The public resolver supports the following features:

-   [EIP-137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137) - Contract address interface (`addr()`)
-   [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165) - Interface Detection (`supportsInterface()`)
-   [EIP-181](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-181) - Reverse Resolution (`name()`)
-   [EIP-205](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-205) - ABI Resolution for contracts (`ABI()`)
-   [EIP-619](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-619) - SECP256k1 public keys (`pubkey()`)
-   [EIP-634](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-634) - Text records (`text()`)
-   [EIP-1577](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1577) - Content hash resolution (`contenthash()`)
-   [EIP-2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304) - Multicoin support (`addr()`)

<Note>
    While the `PublicResolver` provides a convenient default implementation.
    Many versions & variations may exist, and it is therefore not recommended to
    hardcode any addresses. To ensure a safe implementation, always use the `supportsInterface()` method to check for the existence of a specific interface.
    See [Interacting with a Resolver](/resolvers/interacting) for how to do this.
</Note>

## Permissions

The public resolver supports the notion of a "owner" and "manager".
