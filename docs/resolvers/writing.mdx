# Writing a Resolver

Every ENS name has a resolver, which is responsible for resolving information about a name.
By writing your own resolver contract you can extend the functionality of your name, subnames, and more.

resolvers are a core part of the ENS protocol

they give the power to a name "node" to control the resolution process from itself onwards (its subdomains etc)

resolvers were originally standardized in EIP 137, but have since received a few updates such as [EIP 181](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-181), [EIP 2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304), and [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10).

## Resolver Interface

the idea of a resolver is pretty straight forward. "any contract that implements the resolver interface". There have been a few extensions to the original interface, however a summarized interface is defined as follows:

```solidity
contract MyResolver {
    fn addr(bytes32 node) public view returns (address);
}
```

## Wildcard Resolution

In [ENSIP-10](/ensip/10) a new method was added to the resolver interface, the `resolve()` method.
This method allows for fetching 

```solidity
interface ExtendedResolver {
    function resolve(bytes calldata name, bytes calldata data) external view returns(bytes);
}
```

<Note>
Don't forget to add `0x9061b923` to your [EIP-165](https://eips.ethereum.org/) `supportsInterface()` implementation.

## Offchain Resolution

When you write your own resolver you are able to leverage the power of CCIP Read. More about writing a ccip-enabled resolver [here](/resolvers/ccip)
