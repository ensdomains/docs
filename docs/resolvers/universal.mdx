# Universal Resolver

## Overview

The Universal Resolver is a contract that handles the work of resolving a name entirely onchain, making it possible to make a single smart contract call to resolve an ENS name.

Note that this contract is already built into libraries like [viem](https://viem.sh) and [ENSjs](https://github.com/ensdomains/ensjs), so most developers don't typically need to use it directly.

### Forward Resolution

To resolve one or more records for a name, use one of the `resolve` methods, such as `resolve(bytes name, bytes data)`.

The `name` argument for these methods will be the [DNS-encoded](/resolution/names#dns) version of the name. Make sure to [normalize](/resolution/names#normalize) the name first, as well! For example, given the name `My.Name.eth`:

1. Normalize:
   - `My.Name.eth` -> `my.name.eth`
2. DNS Encode:
   - `my.name.eth` -> `0x026d79046e616d650365746800`

The `data` argument for these methods will be an ABI-encoded call to the resolver for that name.

For example, if you want to resolve the ETH address for `my.name.eth`, using the `addr(bytes32 node)` method, then the corresponding ABI-encoded call would be:

```
0x3b3b57def61adbd8ee36cf930560efc644af752731733dc6421afe47608f8e2cfeaabe2b
```

See here for standard resolver methods: [Resolver Interface Standards](/resolvers/interfaces)

### Reverse Resolution

To reverse-resolve an address to an ENS name, call one of the `reverse` methods, such as `reverse(bytes reverseName)`.

The `reverseName` argument for these methods will be the [DNS-encoded](/resolution/names#dns) version of the reverse name. The "reverse name" is `[addr].addr.reverse`, where `[addr]` is the Ethereum public address (without the "0x"). Make sure to [normalize](/resolution/names#normalize) the name as well! For example, given the address `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63`:

1. Construct Reverse Name:
   - `0x231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63` -> `231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63.addr.reverse`
2. Normalize:
   - `231b0Ee14048e9dCcD1d247744d114a4EB5E8E63.addr.reverse` -> `231b0ee14048e9dccd1d247744d114a4eb5e8e63.addr.reverse`
3. DNS Encode:
   - `231b0ee14048e9dccd1d247744d114a4eb5e8e63.addr.reverse` -> `0x28323331623065653134303438653964636364316432343737343464313134613465623565386536330461646472077265766572736500`
