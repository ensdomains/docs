## Abstract
The cross-chain write deferral protocol, aka CCIP-Write, facilitates replacing Ethereum L1 storage with L2 chains and/or centralised databases wherever appropriate, with an aim to cut gas costs and further privacy while retaining the secure aspects of on-chain storage. Methods in this document specifically target security and cost-effectiveness of write deferrals. The cross-chain data written with these methods can be retrieved by generic EIP-3668-compliant contracts completing the cross-chain data life cycle. This document, alongside EIP-3668, is a meaningful step toward a secure infrastructure for cross-chain write deferrals and data retrievals.

## Motivation
EIP-3668, aka 'CCIP-Read', has been key to retrieving cross-chain data for a variety of contracts on Ethereum blockchain, ranging from price feeds for DeFi contracts, to more recently records for ENS users. The latter case dedicatedly uses cross-chain storage to bypass the usually high gas fees associated with on-chain storage; this aspect has a plethora of use cases well beyond ENS records and a potential for significant impact on universal affordability and accessibility of Ethereum. 

Cross-chain data retrieval through EIP-3668 is a relatively simpler task since it assumes that all relevant data originating from cross-chain storages is translated by CCIP-Read-compliant HTTP gateways; this includes L2 chains and centralised databases (or decentralised storages, although they are not covered by this draft). On the flip side however, so far each service leveraging CCIP-Read must handle writing this data securely to these storage types on their own, while also incorporating reasonable security measures in their CCIP-Read-compatible contracts for verifying this data on L1. While these security measures are in-built into L2 architectures, database storage providers on the other hand must incorporate some form of explicit security measures during write operations so that cross-chain data's integrity can be verified by CCIP-Read contracts during data retrieval stage.

EIP-5559 is the first step toward such a tolerant CCIP-Write protocol which outlines how secure write deferrals can be made to L2s and centralised databases. The cases of L2s and databases are similar; deferral to an L2 involves routing the `eth_call` to another EVM, while deferral to a database can be made by extracting `eth_sign` from `eth_call` and posting the resulting signature explicitly along with the data for later verification.

## Specification
### Overview
The following specification revolves around the structure and description of a cross-chain storage handler tasked with the responsibility of writing to an L2 or database storage. This draft introduces `StorageHandledByL2()` and `StorageHandledByDatabase()` storage handlers, and proposes that new `StorageHandledBy__()` reverts be allowed through new EIPs that sufficiently detail their interfaces and designs. Some foreseen examples of new storage handlers include `StorageHandledBySolana()` for Solana, `StorageHandledByFilecoin()` for Filecoin, `StorageHandledByIPFS()` for IPFS, `StorageHandledByIPNS()` for IPNS, `StorageHandledByArweave()` for Arweave, `StorageHandledByArNS()` for ArNS, `StorageHandledBySwarm()` for Swarm etc.

### L2 Handler: `StorageHandledByL2()`
A minimal L2 handler only requires the list of `chainId` values and the corresponding `contract` addresses, while the clients must ensure that the calldata is invariant under routing to L2. One example implementation of an L2 handler in an L1 contract is shown below.

```solidity
// Define revert event
error StorageHandledByL2(
    address contractL2, 
    uint256 chainId
);

// Generic function in a contract
function setValue(
    bytes32 node,
    bytes32 key,
    bytes32 value
) external {
    // Get metadata from on-chain sources
    (
        address contractL2, // Contract address on L2; may be globally constant
        uint256 chainId // L2 ChainID; may be globally constant
    ) = getMetadata(node); // Arbitrary code
    // contract = 0x32f94e75cde5fa48b6469323742e6004d701409b
    // chainId = 21
    // Defer write call to L2 handler
    revert StorageHandledByL2( 
        contractL2,
        chainId
    );
};
```

In this example, the deferral must prompt the client to build the transaction with the exact same original calldata, and submit it to the L2 by calling the exact same function on L2 as L1.

```solidity
// Function in L2 contract
function setValue(
    bytes32 node,
    bytes32 key,
    bytes32 value
) external {
    // Verify owner or manager permissions
    require(authorised(node), "NOT_ALLOWED");
    // Store data mapped by node & sender
    data[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(node, msg.sender))][key] = value
}
```

### Database Handler: `StorageHandledByDatabase()`
A minimal database handler is similar to an L2 in the sense that:

  a) Similar to `chainId`, it requires the `gatewayUrl` that is tasked with handling off-chain write operations, and

  b) Similar to `eth_call`, it requires `eth_sign` output to secure the data, and the client must prompt the users for these signatures.

This specification does not require any other data to be stored on L1 other than the bespoke `gatewayUrl`; the storage handler therefore should only return the `gatewayUrl` in revert.

```solidity
error StorageHandledByDatabase(
    string gatewayUrl
);

// Generic function in a contract
function setValue(
    bytes32 node,
    bytes32 key,
    bytes32 value
) external {
    (
        string gatewayUrl // Gateway URL; may be globally constant
    ) = getMetadata(node);
    // gatewayUrl = "https://api.namesys.xyz"
    // Defer write call to database handler
    revert StorageHandledByDatabase( 
        gatewayUrl
    );
};
```

Following the revert, the client must take these steps:

1. Request the user for a secret signature `sigKeygen` to generate a deterministic `dataSigner` keypair,

2. Sign the calldata with generated data signer's private key and produce verifiable data signature `sigData`,

3. Request the user for an `approval` approving the generated data signer, and finally,

4. Post the calldata to gateway along with signatures `sigData` and `approval`, and the `dataSigner`.

These steps are described in detail below.

#### 1. Generate Data Signer
The data signer must be generated deterministically from ethereum wallet signatures; see figure below.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/namesys-ccip-write/main/images/keygen.png)

The deterministic key generation can be implemented concisely in a single unified `keygen()` function as follows.

```js
/* Pseudo-code for key generation */
function keygen(
  username, // CAIP identifier for the blockchain account
  sigKeygen, // Deterministic signature from wallet
  password // Optional password
) {
  // Calculate input key by hashing signature bytes using SHA256 algorithm
  let inputKey = sha256(sigKeygen);
  // Calculate salt for keygen by hashing concatenated username, hashed password and hex-encoded signature using SHA256 algorithm
  let salt = sha256(`${username}:${sha256(password || "")}:${sigKeygen}`);
  // Calculate hash key output by feeding input key, salt & username to the HMAC-based key derivation function (HKDF) with dLen = 42
  let hashKey = hkdf(sha256, inputKey, salt, username, 42);
  // Calculate and return secp256k1 keypair
  return secp256k1(hashKey) // Calculate secp256k1 keypair from hash key
}
```

This `keygen()` function requires three variables: `username`, `password` and `sigKeygen`. Their definitions are given below.

##### `username`
CAIP-10 identifier `username` is auto-derived from the connected wallet's checksummed address `wallet` and `chainId`.

```js
/* CAIP-10 identifier */
const caip10 = `eip155:${chainId}:${wallet}`
```

##### `password`
`password` is an optional private field and it must be prompted from the user by the client; this field allows users to change data signers for a given `username`.
```js
/* Secret derived key identifier */ 
// Clients must prompt the user for this
const password = 'key1'
```

##### `sigKeygen`
The data signer must be derived from the owner or manager keys of a node. Message payload for the required `sigKeygen` must then be formatted as:

```text
Requesting Signature To Generate Keypair(s)\n\nOrigin: ${username}\nProtocol: ${protocol}\nExtradata: ${extradata}
```

where the `extradata` is calculated as follows,

```solidity
// Calculating extradata in keygen signatures
bytes32 extradata = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        pbkdf2(
            password, 
            salt, 
            iterations
        ), // Stretch password with PBKDF2
        wallet
    )
)
```

where `PBKDF2` - with `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(username))` as salt and last 5 hex-nibbles converted to `uint` as the iteration count - is used for brute-force vulnerability protection.

```js
/* Definitions of salt and iterations in PBKDF2 */
let salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(username));
let iterations = uint(salt.slice(-5)); // max(iterations) = uint(0xFFFFF) = 1048757
```

The remaining `protocol` field is a protocol-specific identifier limiting the scope to a specific protocol represented by a unique contract address. This identifier cannot be global and must be uniquely defined for each implementating `contract` such that:

```js
/* Protocol identifier in CAIP-10 format */
const protocol = `eth:${chainId}:${contract}`;
```

With this deterministic format for signature message payload, the client must prompt the user for the ethereum signature. Once the user signs the messages, the `keygen()` function can derive the data signer keypair. 

#### 2. Sign Data
Since the derived signer is wallet-specific, it can 

- sign batch data for multiple keys for a given node, and 
- sign batches of data for multiple nodes owned by a wallet

simultaneously in the background without ever prompting the user. Signature(s) `sigData` accompanying the off-chain calldata must implement the following format in their message payloads:  

```text
Requesting Signature To Update Off-Chain Data\n\nOrigin: ${username}\nData Type: ${dataType}\nData Value: ${dataValue}
```

where `dataType` parameters are protocol-specific and formatted as object keys delimited by `/`. For instance, if the off-chain data is nested in keys as `a > b > c > field > key`, then the equivalent `dataType` is `a/b/c/field/key`. For example, in order to update off-chain ENS record `text > avatar` and `address > 60`, `dataType` must be formatted as `text/avatar` and `address/60` respectively.
 
#### 3. Approve Data Signer
To further save on gas costs, we do not store the `dataSigner` on L1 as previously mentioned. Instead, the clients must

- request an `approval` signature for `dataSigner` signed by the owner or manager of a node, and
- post this `approval` and the `dataSigner` along with the signed calldata in encoded form.

CCIP-Read-enabled contracts can then verify during resolution time that the `approval` attached with the signed calldata comes from the node's manager or owner, and that it approves the expected `dataSigner`. The `approval` signature must have the following message payload format:

```text
Requesting Signature To Approve Data Signer\n\nOrigin: ${username}\nApproved Signer: ${dataSigner}\nApproved By: ${caip10}
```

where `dataSigner` must be checksummed.

#### 4. Post CCIP-Read Compatible Payload
The final EIP-3668-compatible `data` payload in the off-chain data file must then follow the format

```solidity
bytes encodedData = abi.encode(['bytes'], [dataValue])
bytes dataPayload = abi.encode(
    ['address', 'bytes32', 'bytes32', 'bytes'],
    [dataSigner, sigData, approval, encodedData]
)
```

The client must construct this `data` and pass it to the gateway in the `POST` request along with the raw values for indexing. The CCIP-Read-enabled contracts after decoding the four parameters from this `data` must 

- verify that the `dataSigner` is approved by the owner or manager of the node through `approval`, and
- verify that the `sigData` is produced by `dataSigner`

before resolving the `encodedData` value in decoded form.

##### `POST` Request
The `POST` request made by the client to the `gatewayUrl` must follow the format as described below.

```ts
/* POST request format*/
type Post = {
  node: string
  preimage: string
  chainId: number
  approval: string
  payload: {
    field1: {
      value: string
      signature: string
      timestamp: number
      data: string
    }
    field2: [
      {
        index: number
        value: string
        signature: string
        timestamp: number
        data: string
      }
    ]
    field3: [
      {
        key: number
        value: string
        signature: string
        timestamp: number
        data: string
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Example of a complete `Post` typed object for updating multiple ENS records for a node is shown below.

```ts

let post: Post = {

### New Revert Events
1. Each new storage handler must submit their `StorageHandledBy__()` identifier through an ERC track proposal referencing the current draft.

2. Each `StorageHandledBy__()` provider must be supported with detailed documentation of its structure and the necessary metadata that its implementers must return.

3. Each `StorageHandledBy__()` proposal must define the precise formatting of any message payloads that require signatures and complete descriptions of custom cryptographic techniques implemented for additional security, accessibility or privacy.

## Implementation featuring ENS on L2 & Database
ENS off-chain resolvers capable of reading from and writing to databases are perhaps the most common use-case for CCIP-Read and CCIP-Write. One example of such a (minimal) resolver is given below along with the client-side code for handling the storage handler revert.

### L1 Contract
```solidity
/* ENS resolver implementing StorageHandledByDatabase() */
interface iResolver {
    // Defined in EIP-5559
    error StorageHandledByL2(
        uint chainId,
        address contractL2
    );
    error StorageHandledByDatabase(
        string gatewayUrl
    );
    // Defined in EIP-137
    function setAddr(bytes32 node, address addr) external;
}

// Defined in EIP-5559
string public gatewayUrl = "https://post.namesys.xyz"; // RESTful API endpoint
uint256 public chainId = uint(21); // ChainID of L2
address public contractL2 = "0x839B3B540A9572448FD1B2335e0EB09Ac1A02885"; // Contract on L2

/**
* Sets the ethereum address associated with an ENS node
* [!] May only be called by the owner or manager of that node in ENS registry
* @param node Namehash of ENS domain to update
* @param addr Ethereum address to set
*/
function setAddr(
    bytes32 node,
    address addr
) authorised(node) {
    // Defer to database storage
    revert StorageHandledByDatabase(
        gatewayUrl
    );
}

/**
* Sets the avatar text record associated with an ENS node
* [!] May only be called by the owner or manager of that node in ENS registry
* @param node Namehash of ENS domain to update
* @param key Key for ENS text record
* @param value URL to avatar
*/
function setText(
    bytes32 node,
    string key,
    string value
) external {
    // Verify owner or manager permissions
    require(authorised(node), "NOT_ALLOWED");
    // Defer to L2 storage
    revert StorageHandledByL2(
        chainId, 
        contractL2
    );
}
```

### L2 Contract
```solidity
// Function in L2 contract
function setText(
    bytes32 node,
    bytes32 key,
    bytes32 value
) external {
    // Store record mapped by node & sender
    records[keccak256(abi.encodePacked(node, msg.sender))]["text"][key] = value;
}
```

### Client-side Code
```ts
/* Client-side pseudo-code in ENS App */
// Deterministically generate signer keypair
let signer = keygen(username, sigKeygen, password);
// Construct POST body by signing calldata with derived private key
let post: Post = signData(node, addr, signer.priv);
// POST to gateway
await fetch(gatewayUrl, {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(post)
});
```

## Backwards Compatibility
Methods in this document are not compatible with previous EIP-5559 specifications.

## Security Considerations
1. Clients must purge the derived signer private keys from local storage immediately after signing the off-chain data.

2. Signature message payload and the resulting deterministic signature `sigKeygen` must be treated as a secret by the clients and immediately purged from local storage after usage in the `keygen()` function.

3. Clients must immediately purge the `password` from local storage after usage in the `keygen()` function.
