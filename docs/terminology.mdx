# Terminology

This page contains a glossary of terms used in the ENS documentation.

## Controller

The account that may edit the records of a name. The Controller may be changed by the Registrant or Controller.

## Label

An individual component of a name, such as 'alice'.

## Labelhash

The keccak256 hash of an individual label.

## Name

An ENS identifier such as 'alice.eth'. Names may consist of multiple parts, called labels, separated by dots.

## Namehash

The algorithm used to process an ENS name and return a cryptographic hash uniquely identifying that name. Namehash takes a name as input and produces a _node_.

## Node

A cryptographic hash uniquely identifying a name.

## Owner

The owner of a name is the entity referenced in the ENS registry's owner field. An owner may transfer ownership, set a resolver or TTL, and create or reassign subdomains.

## Registrar

A registrar is a contract responsible for allocating subdomains. Registrars can be configured at any level of ENS, and are pointed to by the owner field of the registry.

## Registration

A registration is a registrar's record of a user's ownership of a name. This is distinct from the owner field in the Registry; registrations are maintained in the registrar contract and additionally store information on expiry date, fees paid, etc.

## Registrant

The owner of a registration. The registrant may transfer the registration, set the Controller, and reclaim ownership of the name in the registry if required.

## Registry

The core contract of ENS, the registry maintains a mapping from domain name (at any level - x, y.x, z.y.x etc) to owner, resolver, and time-to-live.

## Resolver

A resolver is a contract that maps from name to the resource (e.g., cryptocurrency addresses, content hash, etc). Resolvers are pointed to by the resolver field of the registry.
