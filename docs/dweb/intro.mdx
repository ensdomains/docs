# Hosting a Decentralized Website

<WIP />

## ContentHash {{ title: 'the \'contenthash\' field' }}

The ContentHash is a very popular component of an ENS name, first introduced in [ENSIP-7](/ensip/7).
It can be queried by hitting the [contenthash(bytes32)](/resolvers/interfaces#0xbc1c58d1) function on a name's resolver.
You can also [set the contenthash on a name](/resolvers/interfaces#0x304e6ade) if the resolver supports it.

<div className="card1 p-4 flex justify-center gap-4">
  {
    ['ipfs://qMhx...', 'bzz:/2477', 'ar://HGa8...'].map((tag) => (
      <span key={tag} className="tag tag-blue">{tag}</span> 
    ))
  }
</div>

## Hosting & Pinning {{ id: 'hosting' }}

When it comes to hosting your files there are many options to choose from.

<div className="card1 p-4 flex justify-center gap-4">
  {
    ['IPFS / Filecoin', 'Swarm', 'Arweave'].map((tag) => (
      <span key={tag} className="tag tag-blue">{tag}</span> 
    ))
  }
</div>

Popular options include [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), [Swarm](https://ethswarm.org), and [Arweave](https://arweave.org).
Depending on what option you go with your files are either permanently stored on a network,
or require to be actively stored on atleast one machine, also known as "pinning".

### Deploy your site {{ id: 'deploy' }}

Several helpful tools and platforms exist that you can use to deploy your website to IPFS, Swarm, or Arweave.
Most notably [fleek](https://fleek.xyz), [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud), and [Blumen](https://blumen.stauro.dev/).
Helping you easily deploy your website to a decentralized storage network.

## Setting your ContentHash {{ id: 'set' }}

If you are using the public resolver (the default for names registered using the ENS Manager App), you can set the contenthash directly from within the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains).

If you are using a custom resolver, or are writing your own resolver you will be able to have more fine grained control over the contenthash field.
See [ENSIP-7](/ensip/7) for more information on the contenthash field.

## Browser Support & Gateways {{ id: 'gateway' }}

In the ideal world every browser supports decentralized websites out of the box.
If you are using [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or [Brave Browser](https://brave.com) you can already access IPFS websites directly.
On non-conforming browsers you can use a gateway such as [eth.link](https://eth.link) or [eth.limo](https://eth.limo) to access your website.
You can test if your browser supports decentralized websites by visiting [ens.eth](https://ens.eth) or use a gateway via [ens.eth.link](https://ens.eth.link).
