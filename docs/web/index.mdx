# Getting Started

This section walks you through how to leverage the ENS open standards to improve the user experience of your app.

## Tools and Libraries

ENS is an integral part of the Ethereum ecosystem.
Fortunately, the open-source community is to the rescue, and almost all of the tools and libraries you use today support ENS.
To learn more check out the [tools & libraries section](/web/libraries).

{/* ## Examples

If you just want to see some code in action we have a variety of codesnippet & template repository examples available at

    {[''].map((a)=>(<div className="card1 px-2 py-0">{a}</div>))}
</div> */}

## Avatars, Addresses & Records

Information about a name can be fetched from its resolver, this can be done using pre-built features included in your tooling, or manually by calling the resolver contract directly.
If you're interested in interacting with the resolver contract directly, you might find the [Resolver Reference](/resolvers/interfaces) section helpful.
