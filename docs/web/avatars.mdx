# Avatars

Personalization of profiles is what makes identity great.
This page covers the very special **avatar** record that enables users to take their avatar with them across the web.

## Getting the user's Avatar {{ navtitle: 'Getting an Avatar', id: 'avatars', tag: 'Avatar' }}

Avatars are an awesome way for users to express themselves. To get the user's avatar, all you need is their **name**. If you only have their address, see [primary names](/web/reverse#get).
The following code snippets let you get the avatar for a user.

<CodeGroup title="Request">

```tsx {{ variant: 'wagmi', link: 'https://wagmi.sh/react/hooks/useEnsAvatar', stackblitz: 'https://stackblitz.com/edit/ens-wagmi-use-ens-avatar' }}
import { useEnsAvatar } from "wagmi";

function App() {
  const { data: ensAvatar } = useEnsAvatar({
    address: "luc.eth",
    chainId: 1, // (1 = Ethereum Mainnet, 5 = Goerli)
  });

  return (
    <img
      src={ensAvatar || "https://avatars.jakerunzer.com/luc.eth"}
      alt="luc.eth"
    />
  );
}
```

```ts {{ variant: 'ethers-v5' }}
const ensAvatar = await provider.getAvatar("luc.eth");
```

```ts {{ variant: 'viem', link: 'https://viem.sh/docs/ens/actions/getEnsAvatar.html', stackblitz: 'https://stackblitz.com/edit/ens-viem-get-ens-avatar' }}
import { normalize } from "viem/ens";
import { publicClient } from "./client";

const ensAvatar = await publicClient.getEnsAvatar({
  name: normalize("luc.eth"),
});
```

```go {{ title: "Go", variant: "go" }}
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/ethclient"
	ens "github.com/wealdtech/go-ens/v3"
)

func main() {
	client, _ := ethclient.Dial("https://rpc.ankr.com/eth")

	domain, _ := ens.Normalize("luc.eth")
	resolver, _ := ens.NewResolver(client, domain)
	avatar, _ := resolver.Text("avatar")

	fmt.Println("Avatar: ", avatar)
}
```

### The Metadata Service

The [metadata service](https://metadata.ens.domains/docs) is run by ENS Labs. It is a free service web service that allows you to retrieve the
avatar of an ENS name via a web request, as opposed to adding extra logic to your application and interacting
with an ethereum node. This is of course centralised and should be used if absolutely necessary.

## What exactly is an Avatar Record? {{ navtitle: 'What is it exactly?', id: 'avatar-record', tag: 'Avatar' }}

An avatar record is simply a [text record](/web/records) that has "avatar" as its key and a URI as its value,
with some rules about what URI schemes are supported and how to process them. For more info, see [ENSIP-11](/ensip/12).

## Supported URI schemes {{ navtitle: 'Supported URI schemas', id: 'uri-schemas', tag: 'URI' }}

Clients are expected to support a number of URI schemas, which aren't always web URIs, so the final result you see in your application
will vary depending on how the library you are using has decided to handle avatar records.

- `http(s):` - URI Scheme for for HTTP(S) URLs. Libraries will most likely return the result directly.
- `ipfs:` - URI scheme for [IPFS hashes](). Libraries may decide to fetch the result from a public gateway for you.
- `data:` - URI Scheme for [data URIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URLs).
  Libraries will most likely return the result directly.
- `eip155:` - The URI scheme for EIP-155 identifiers for linking to NFTs on Ethereum based chains. A little complicated
  to resolve manually, most libraries should resolve this for you and return the underlying resource.

<Note>
  For EIP-155 NFT Avatars the nft must be owned by the wallet address the ENS
  name resolves to. This is done by checking the `ownerOf` method on the NFT
  contract.
</Note>

## Common schemes that aren't officially supported {{ navtitle: 'Common schemas', id: 'common-schemas', tag: 'URI' }}

- `ethereum:` - The URI scheme for Ethereum addresses
- `bzz:` - The URI scheme for Swarm hashes

## File Information {{ navtitle: 'File Information', id: 'files', tag: 'Metadata' }}

Avatars come in many different shapes and sizes. Not just the above URI schemas, but also in different file formats, sizes, and more.
Although standards exist for some of these, files are **not required** to follow these standards.

Below is some information about the avatars your app might be loading.

| FileProperty:  | Info/Recommendation                                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Extension | Mostly `png`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `webp`, `gif`, `webm`, but could be anything       |
| File Size      | We recommend having sensible timeouts                                           |
| Aspect Ratio   | We recommend `object-fit: cover` or setting a background color                  |
| Transparency   | We recommend setting a background color as some images may contain transparency |

Luckily most browsers and network libraries have default timeouts to start with, we highly recommend that if you are doing any manual avatar downloading or fetching you add a sensible timeout.
