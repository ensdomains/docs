# Listing a Users Names

In some cases you might want to show off all names that a user has. Due to the nature of how the ENS Protocol works under the hood this might be a slightly more difficult task.
Luckily tooling has been written to accommodate for this and to make it easier.

<div className="card1 px-8 py-4 flex justify-center gap-2">
    <span>0x225...c3B5</span>
    <span>➡️</span>
    <div className="block border-l-2 pl-2">
        <div>luc.eth</div>
        <div>lucemans.eth</div>
        <div>keukenrol.eth</div>
    </div>
</div>

## Why not all names? {{ title: "Enumeration", id: "enumeration" }}

ENS Resolution ([read more here](/resolution)) relies on smart-contracts & external logic to resolve from name to address.
This means that ahead of time we don't know what names a user has.
Notable exceptions include [first-layer](/terminology#first-layer) [.eth names](/registry/eth), and [wrapped names](/subnames/wrapper),
these are on-chain, and indexable through scanning events on the appropriate contracts.

## Guidelines

When using one of the methods described below It is important to keep in mind that you should always allow for a user to manually enter a name, as not all names are indexable.
It is generally recommended to allow users to input a name using an [input box](todo-link) and to verify it resolves to the correct address upon user-completion.

  <div className="flex flex-col">
    <div className="grow p-2 flex items-center justify-center">

    </div>
    <div className="bg-ens-light-background-secondary dark:bg-ens-dark-background-secondary px-4 py-2 space-x-1">
      <span className="text-ens-light-green-primary dark:text-ens-dark-green-primary">Do</span><span>- Fallback to raw name entry</span>

  <div className="flex flex-col border-l border-ens-light-border dark:border-ens-dark-border">

      <span className="text-ens-light-red-bright dark:text-ens-dark-red-bright">Don't</span><span>- Assume all names are owned</span>
    </div>

## Alchemy {{ title: "Alchemy" }}

The Alchemy platform has provided several endpoints for interacting with ENS names as well as to query a list of names a user has.

```ts {{ title: 'Alchemy', variant: 'alchemy-sdk', link: "https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-resolve-ens-domains-given-a-wallet-address" }}
// Setup: npm install alchemy-sdk
import { Alchemy, Network } from "alchemy-sdk";

const config = {
    apiKey: "<-- ALCHEMY APP API KEY -->",
    network: Network.ETH_MAINNET,
};
const alchemy = new Alchemy(config);

const walletAddress = "0x458d1E307CcA61C0Bea82f7663F66831175EcDe8"; // replace with wallet address
const ensContractAddress = "0x57f1887a8BF19b14fC0dF6Fd9B2acc9Af147eA85";
const nfts = await alchemy.nft.getNftsForOwner(walletAddress, {
    contractAddresses: [ensContractAddress],
});

console.log(nfts);
```

## The Graph {{ title: "The Graph" }}

The ENS Team has worked together closely with the graph to provide the [ENS Subgraph](/web/subgraph) ([The Graph](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/ensdomains/ens)). This subgraph indexes ENS name registrations & wrapping of names that are part of the [ETH Registrar](/registry/eth).

<CodeGroup title="ENS Subgraph">
