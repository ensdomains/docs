# Multichain

<div className="card1 p-8 flex items-center justify-center">
    "the future is multichain"
</div>

Is what I heard some person say at some point at some conference and yeah that's how far we got.

## But isn't ENS on mainnet? {{ label: "ENS Multichain", navtitle: "Resolution" }}

Yes, technically. The resolution process always starts on mainnet. There needs to be, one source of truth after all. However, the name
resolution process can branch off to other chains, offchain gateways and much more. <br /> To read a more indepth explanation of how resolution works, checkout the [section dedicated to the Resolution Process](/resolution/).

## My dapp is on X but I want ENS {{ label: "dApp Multichain", navtitle: "dApps on other Chains" }}

The ENS Protocol can be used on/for any chain! If you are building a non-mainnet dApp and want to use ENS names simply [add a Mainnet RPC to your Wagmi config](/web/libraries) and specify `chainId: 1` in your config like so:

```tsx focus=6
import { useAccount, useEnsName, useEnsAvatar } from 'wagmi';

const Name = () => {
    const { data: ensName } = useEnsAddress({
        address: 'luc.eth',
        chainId: 1, // (1 = Ethereum, 5 = Goerli)
    });

    return <div>{ensName || address}</div>;
};
```

And voila! You can now resolve ENS names anywhere! üéâ
