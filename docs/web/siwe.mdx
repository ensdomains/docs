# Sign In With Ethereum (SIWE)

Authentication is difficult. SIWE makes life easy.

<div className="card1 px-8 py-4 flex justify-center gap-2">
    <span>0x225...c3B5</span>
    <span>➡️</span>
    <span>luc.eth</span>
</div>

## Specification ([see spec](todo-link)) {{ id: "spec", title: "Specification" }}

The SIWE Specification is rather simple. It describes a message format that a user ought to sign using their keys to be able to sign-in.
The message MUST include [a subject](todo-link), [nonce](todo-link), and a [timestamp](todo-link). These parameters prevent replay-attacks, cross-site usage, and more, all while maintaining a very human readable form.

An example payload looks like the following:

```
localhost wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:
0x225f137127d9067788314bc7fcc1f36746a3c3B5

This is a test statement.

URI: https://localhost/login
Version: 1
Chain ID: 1
Nonce: abcdef1234567890
Issued At: 2023-01-30T00:00:00.000Z
```

## Demo

Feel free to give it a try, the button below is a [live interactive demo](todo-link). With source code available [on github](todo-link).

## Implementations

The team at [SpruceID](https://login.xyz) has done a phenomenal job writing plug-and-play utilities that let you easily integrate ethereum-based authentication into your project.
Whether you are using [Next.js](todo-link), [React](todo-link), or [OpenID Connect](todo-link).

In addition to the above SIWE has been integrated into [connectkit](todo-link) & more.
