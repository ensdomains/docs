# Naming Contracts

For most regular wallets you can set your primary name from within the [Manager App](https://ens.domains).
However also smart contracts can have names, and even better they can have primary names.

```
governance.uniswap.eth
```

In order for you to manage the primary name of your smart contract, you need to own the [reverse node](/terminology#reverse-node) for the contract address.
There are several ways of doing this, depending on if you are actively developing your contract or if it is already deployed.

## New Contracts

If you are developing a new contract, and you want to be able to easily set the ENS Primary Name for it.

### ReverseClaimer.sol

There is a simple drop-in module called the [ReverseClaimer.sol](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/blob/master/contracts/reverseRegistrar/ReverseClaimer.sol)

```solidity
contract MyContract is ReverseClaimer {
    constructor (ENS ens) ReverseClaimer(ens, msg.sender) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

When you deploy your contract it will automatically claim the reverse node for that contract address.

### Ownable (OpenZeppelin) {{ id: 'ownable' }}

You can can also choose to have your smart-contract implement [Ownable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#Ownable) from OpenZeppelin.
The ReverseRegistrar supports the Ownable interface and will let the `Owner` set a Primary name.

### Manually

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.8.17 <0.9.0;

import {ENS} from "../registry/ENS.sol";
import {IReverseRegistrar} from "../reverseRegistrar/IReverseRegistrar.sol";

contract ReverseClaimer {
    bytes32 constant ADDR_REVERSE_NODE =
        0x91d1777781884d03a6757a803996e38de2a42967fb37eeaca72729271025a9e2;

    constructor(ENS ens, address claimant) {
        IReverseRegistrar reverseRegistrar = IReverseRegistrar(ens.owner(ADDR_REVERSE_NODE));
        reverseRegistrar.claim(claimant);
    }
}
```

You can read more about setting a primary name for a contract in on the [support page](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7902626-set-primary-name-for-contract).

## Existing Contracts

If your contract is already deployed you might still be able to set a name for it.
If your contract supports the [Ownable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/access#Ownable) interface from OpenZeppelin, you can use the tool above to set a name for it.

### Safe, Multisig & DAO

If your contract is a Safe, Multisig, DAO, or has a function that can send arbitrary ETH calls, you can use the [ReverseRegistrar](/registry/reverse) contract directly to set a name for it.
You might even be able to use the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app/) inside of your safe app to set a primary name.

## Setting a name for your contract

Once you have granted yourself ownership of the contract's reverse node you can set the name for the contract.
You can do so by hitting the `setNameForAddr` function on the [Reverse Registrar](/registry/reverse).

From your contract you can execute `setName` function on the [Reverse Registrar](/registry/reverse)
