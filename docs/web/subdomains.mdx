# Subdomains

Names come in handy in many situations. We believe that any place an address is used, a name should be able to be used instead.
The smart contracts you interact with have names, the deposit address for your favorite exchange has a name, your favorite DAO has a name, or maybe you use subnames to keep your wallets organized.

<div className="card1 p-4 flex justify-center items-center overflow-hidden text-xl">
  <div className="text-right font-bold">
    {['vault', 'domico', 'subname', 'nick', 'cold'].map((subname, i) => (
      <div
        className={
          ['opacity-20', 'opacity-50', '', 'opacity-50', 'opacity-20'][i]
        }
      >
        {subname}
      </div>
    ))}
  </div>
  <div className="font-bold">.nick.eth</div>
</div>

Luckily, the ENS Protocol has so much to offer for you to play with. There are a variety of ways you can give out subdomains to your apps users, set them up for yourself, or more.

If you are interested in naming smart-contracts specifically, check out the [Naming Smart Contracts](/web/naming-contracts) page.

## Pre-built Tooling

### Durin (new!)

[Durin](https://durin.dev/) is an opinionated approach to issuing ENS subnames on L2. It takes care of the L1 Resolver and offchain gateway parts of the [CCIP Read stack](/resolvers/ccip-read) for you, so you can focus on the business logic of your L2 smart contracts.

### NameWrapper

The [NameWrapper](/wrapper/overview) is a smart contract that allows you to issue trustless on-chain subdomains.
NameWrapper subdomains come in the form of [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) NFTs, which can be transferred, sold, or traded. Read our guide to [creating an onchain subname registrar](/wrapper/creating-subname-registrar) to learn more.

### Legacy Subdomains

In the previous version of the ETHRegistrar, you could register subdomains for a name. These subdomains are always owner-controlled, and can be transferred. They are also stored on-chain, but are not in the form of a standard NFT.

You can register a legacy subdomain by calling the `setSubnodeRecord` function on the [ENS Registry](/registry/ens) contract.

## Writing your own Resolver

You can always opt to [write your own resolver](/resolvers/writing) in solidity, doing so will give you absolute programmatic control over how resolution for your name and its subnames will behave.
Requires deploying a smart contract.

### Offchain & Layer 2

To load data from an off-chain location, such as layer 2, database, or file.
A resolver can leverage [CCIP Read](/resolvers/ccip-read) to load data from an off-chain location.

Tooling has been built to allow you to easily deploy a template resolver, or leverage a library to load data from offchain.

#### Unruggable Gateway

The [Unruggable Gateway](https://gateway-docs.unruggable.com/) is a set of solidity tooling that allows you to write a resolver that can trustlessly load storage slots from an EVM-compatible chain.

#### CCIP Tools

If you are looking to skip writing & deploying a contract to mainnet you can use [ccip.tools](https://ccip.tools)'s proxy factory.
This allows you to easily, and at low deployment cost deploy a resolver that can load data from a CCIP endpoint.

This allows you to easily deploy a resolver that can load from your [Gateway API](/resolvers/ccip-read) without having to write any solidity code.
