# Smart Contracts

The Ethereum Name Service is made up of a set of smart contracts.
These smart contracts are responsible for storing and managing information associated with names.

## Resolution

The resolution process outlines how a name is resolved.
This includes the process of finding a resolver, and then using that resolver to fetch information about a name.

## Resolvers

Every name has a resolver, responsible for fetching information about a name, such as address, avatar, and more.
Resolvers allow for programmatic control over the information associated with a name, implemented in solidity.

There are various resolvers to choose from, such as the [Public Resolver](/resolvers/public) or [write your own](/resolvers/writing).

## Registry & Registrars

The smart contracts can be found on github at [ensdomains/ens-contracts]().
