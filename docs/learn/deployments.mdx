ENS is multichain (read more [here](/learn/multichain)) and can be used in any application.
In addition to being able to query many address formats and record types, data can be stored [practically anywhere](/learn/ccip).
However, resolution needs to start somewhere, so the entrypoint for resolution is Ethereum Mainnet, alongside the most popular testnets.

## But what about multichain? {{ tag: "Multichain", title: "Multichain", id: "multichain" }}

The ENS Protocol can be used on/for any chain! If you are building a dApp and want to use ENS you might have to add a [Mainnet RPC to your Wagmi config](/web/libraries).
This allows tools like wagmi to access mainnet, and load ENS information!
