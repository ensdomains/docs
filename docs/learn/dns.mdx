# DNS on ENS

<>
    {/*TODO: User-friendly explanation of the fact that DNS names also work in the ENS system.*/}
</>

The Ethereum Name Service is so much more then just `.eth` names. It is a general-purpose naming system that can be used for any kind of name. This includes DNS names.
DNS functionality was originally introduced in [ENSIP-6](/ensip/6).

## Importing a DNS name

In the current state of things, DNS names need to be imported into ENS. This is done by providing a valid DNSSEC proof to a smart-contract.
This proof is used to verify that the DNS name is actually owned by the person who is trying to claim it on-chain.

To import a name, simply visit the [ENS Manager](https://ens.app), type in your name, and click "Import DNS". You will be prompted to provide a DNSSEC proof.
If you would like to learn more, there is a guide to walk you through [importing your DNS name](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7882690-claim-your-dns-name).

## Why DNS on ENS?

ENS aims to extend the existing functionality of the DNS system. This also means that existing DNS names (such as `.com`, `.org`, or `.xyz`) should be able to leverage the benefits of the ENS resolution process.

## DNS Names in the wild

DNS names are widely used and many users may already have one without even realizing it. Some major platforms that issue subdomains of their DNS names include:

## Top-Level Domains

In addition to allowing any DNSSEC enabled name to be imported, ENS also allows existing DNS TLDs to take control of their smart-contract resolution process.
Resulting in even more seamless integration with the DNS system.

A list of all supported TLDs can be found [here](/dns/tlds)
