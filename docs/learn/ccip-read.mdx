# Layer 2 & Offchain Resolution

All ENS resolution starts on Ethereum Mainnet.
However by leveraging the [CCIP Read](/resolvers/ccip-read) name resolution can be taken cross-chain, off-chain, and more.
This allows for a lot of flexibility in how you can use your ENS.
And for storage of your ENS records on your favourite Layer 2, or even off-chain.

## Resolvers on Layer 2

Its already possible to deploy a resolver to a Layer 2. This is done by verifying data returned from a gateway against for example mainnet storage proofs, or other mechanisms depending on the chain.

ENS Labs has created a toolkit called the [EVMGateway](https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway) which helps with trustless cross-chain data retrieval.
This allows you for example to have your name be controlled by a Resolver on Optimism, or Arbitrum, with more EVM compatible chains coming soon.

{/* ## Primary Names on Layer 2

The process of storing primary names on Layer 2 is still under active development and more updates will be posted here as they become available.

## Offchain Resolution

Taking resolution Off-chain comes with many benefits however also with trustlessness tradeoffs.
Depending on the implementation names could be stored in a database, or be ephemeral.
Advantages of offchain name storage includes gaslessness, and instant updates.
If this sounds appealing consider [writing an Offchain Resolver](/resolvers/ccip-read).

Popular implementations of offchain names include but are not limited to:

### cb.id

Coinbase Wallet is one of the largest mobile wallets issuing free ENS subnames to their users.
These names are stored off-chain on coinbase servers, and can be registered from the Coinbase Wallet App or Browser Extension.
An example of a CB.ID is [lucemans.cb.id](https://enstate.rs/n/lucemans.cb.id).

### lens.xyz

The Lens Ecosystem is also readily accessible through the officially maintained `lens.xyz` gateway.
This means that you can lookup your favourite lens name such as [lucemans.lens.xyz](https://enstate.rs/n/lucemans.lens.xyz) and retrieve the information seamlessly.
