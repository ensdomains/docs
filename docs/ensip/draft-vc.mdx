# ENSIP-20: Verifiable Credentials in ENS

### Abstract

This ENSIP aims to standardize the usage of [W3C Verifiable Credentials & Presentations](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/) within ENS records.

### Motivation

With the increasing prevalence of self-custodial digital identity & attestation solutions, it is of importance to have a standardized way to publicly share verifiable credentials using your ENS profile.
Allowing for easy sharing of verifiable credentials right on your profile.

### Specification

#### Verifications in Profiles

Defines the use of the `verifications` record.
This record aims to store a list of verifiable credentials or did's, pointing towards certain credentials.
Under ideal circumstances this record relies on a yet to be written ENSIP that allows for multidimensional records.
However in its current state assumes that the `verifications` record contains an abi encoded `string[]` of verifiable credentials.

```
https://myapp.com/credentials/1234.json
```

#### Credentials & Presentations

The documents stored in the `verifications` record are verifiable credentials or presentations following the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0/).
These credentials are JSON-LD documents that contain a set of claims, metadata, and proof, signed by the issuer.

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
  ],
  "id": "https://example.com/credentials/1234",
  "type": ["VerifiableCredential"],
  "issuanceDate": "2024-05-21T00:00:00Z",
  "credentialSubject": {
    "id": "did:ens:luc.eth",
  }
}
```

Note the requirement for `id` to be `did:ens:luc.eth` in order to prevent credential spoofing.

#### End-User Experience

This method allows users to publicly share their verifiable credentials in a standardized way.
Users can visit an app that lets them create a verifiable credential, and then share the link to that credential in their ENS profile.

Name Manager Applications can then read, and iterate over these credentials and display them in a user-friendly way.
As well as allow for setting/removing/revoking credentials.

#### Developer Experience

{/* TODO: Reword */}
From the front-end developer perspective reading verifiable credentials is as simple as (name, predicate):

```tsx
const { credentials } = useVC('luc.eth', (c) => c.type == 'TelegramCredential');
```

#### Resolver Interface

Although no resolver modifications are required to support this ENSIP, it is recommended to implement a resolver interface that allows for easier and more gas-efficient adding and removing of verifiable credentials.

```solidity
interface IVerifiableCredentialResolver {
    function addCredentials(bytes32 node, bytes[] calldata data) external;
    function removeCredentials(bytes32 node, uint256[] indexes) external;
}

// TODO: Solidity Arrays vs Abi Encoded
interface IVerifiableCredentialMultiResolver {
    function addCredential(bytes32 node, bytes[] calldata data) external;
    function removeCredential(bytes32 node, uint256[] indexes) external;
}
```

After performing a removeCredential operation it is recommended to re-fetch the credentials record to ensure your app shows the correct order.

### Considerations

#### Revocation & Expiration

Verifiable Credentials are meant to be used as long-lived documents.
However this does not mean that they can't be revoked or expired.
In a similar manner to physical documents, a credentials validity can be checked by contacting the issuer or verifying a signature.

The implementation of verification is specific to each issuer, and can be inferred from `verificationMethod` in the credential.
In addition to the `expirationDate` field, which causes the credential to automatically invalidate after a certain date.

This means that identity platforms can allow users to revoke (or expand) credentials without needing to modify the records in ENS.

### Backwards Compatibility

This ENSIP relies on the existing ENS text record functionality introduced in [ENSIP-5](/ensip/5), and only standardizes the usage of the specific `verifications` record.
It imposes forwards compatibility by allowing for future upgrading of record dimensionality while maintaining backwards compatibility.

### Security Considerations

All verifiable credentials stored in a profile or on a blockchain should be assumed to be public and unverified data.
Platforms should decide for themselves what issuers they trust and what credentials they allow and filter for those credentials.
