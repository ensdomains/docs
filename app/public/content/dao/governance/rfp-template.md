## Overview

<!-- A high level overview describing the need for the RFP and what it seeks to accomplish. -->

## Scope of Work

<!-- A detailed description of the work to be done. -->

## Selection Criteria

<!-- What must a winning submission to this RFP contain? This is the place to include details such as information you want to see in all RFP responses, and required qualifications for the winning bidder. -->

## Timeline

| **Submission Period** | <!-- How long submissions will be open for after the RFP is adopted. This can be as short as a week for small jobs, but may be up to a month for large RFPs. --> |
| **Approval Period** | <!-- How long it will take for the RFP manager to select a winning bid after the submission period ends. This should be kept as short as possible given feedback from the RFP manager. --> |
| **Expected Delivery** | <!-- A date or duration for the work to be done. Omitted for RFPs for ongoing services. --> |

## RFP Manager

<!--
  Nominate a person or team to manage the RFP. Typically this will be the stewards of the working group who agrees to adopt the RFP and shepherd it through the process. For smaller RFPs a single steward may be nominated.
-->

## Budget

<!--
  The maximum budget for this RFP. This may be made up of any asset the DAO or a WG holds. Proposals that are self-funded (for example, a swag store) should instead specify the bounds for the share that a winning bidder may retain.
