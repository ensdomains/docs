# Welcome to ENS docs contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our documentation! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [docs.ens.domains](https://docs.ens.domains) :sparkles:.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Getting started

This guide will walk you through the process of contributing to the ENS docs. If you are new to GitHub, you can checkout this [GitHub tutorial](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) to get started.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/ensdomains/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes in the UI

Click **Make a contribution** at the bottom of any docs page to make small changes such as a typo, sentence fix, or a broken link. This takes you to the `.md` file where you can make your changes and [create a pull request](#pull-request) for a review.

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2. (Optional) If you are making any code changes. Install or update to **Node.js**, or run `nvm use` if using [Node Version Manager](https://nvm.sh). For more information, see [the development guide](.github/development.md).

3. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Upon creating a Pull Request your code will automatically be tested :zap:.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Fill the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link PR to issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are solving one.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The ENS team thanks you :sparkles:.

Once your PR is merged, your contributions will be publicly visible on the [ENS Docs](https://docs.ens.domains).
