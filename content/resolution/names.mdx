# Name Processing

When interacting with the ENS protocol smart-contracts directly it is important to note that names are not stored in their human readable format.
In fact there are a few steps a name undergoes before it can be used by a smart-contract.

When building a dApp most of the time you don't have to worry about name processing, as most [libraries](/web/libraries) will handle this for you.

## Validating a Name {{ title: "Validation", id: "validation" }}

ENS names are validated using the [UTS46](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr46/) standard, which is a standard for internationalized domain names.
Validating names against UTS46 ensures that names always produce consistent result, regardless of capitalization.

To simplify the process [todo](#todo) provides `todo`.

## Name Normalization {{ title: "Normalization", id: "normalize" }}

## Namehash {{ title: "Namehash", id: "namehash" }}

In order for us to interface with our nice readable names there needs to be a way we communicate them to smart-contracts.
ENS stores names in a uint256 encoded format we call [a namehash](#namehash), this is done to optimize for gas, performance, and more.
