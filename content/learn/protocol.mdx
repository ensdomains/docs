# What is the Ethereum Name Service?

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.

ENS maps human-readable names like 'alice.eth' to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, metadata, and more.
ENS also supports 'reverse resolution', making it possible to associate metadata such as primary names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

## ETH Registrar

Top-Level Domains (TLDs), like `.eth` and `.test`, are owned by smart contracts called [registrars](/registry/eth), which specify rules governing the allocation of their names.
The [ETH Registrar](/registry/eth) is the registrar for the `.eth` TLD, it allows for trustless decentralized names issued as tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## DNS + ENS

ENS has similar goals to DNS, the existing Internet's Domain Name Service, and aims to extend its capability.
Like DNS, ENS operates on a system of dot-separated hierarchical resolution process.

In addition ENS supports importing DNS names through the use of DNSSEC.
This allows you to take your `.com`, `.xyz`, or `.art` (and more) into the ENS ecosystem. Read more about DNSSEC names [on this page](/learn/dns).

## Subnames

Because of the hierarchal nature of ENS, anyone who owns a domain at any level may configure subdomains - for themselves or others - as desired.
For instance, if Alice owns 'alice.eth', she can create 'pay.alice.eth' and configure it as she wishes.

To read more about subdomains, check out the [Resolution](/resolution/quickstart) page.

## ENS Manager App

You can try ENS out for yourself now by using the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app/), or by using any of the many ENS enabled applications on [our homepage](https://ens.domains/).
