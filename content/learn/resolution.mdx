# Resolution

<Note>
    This document aims to provide a brief overview of how resolution works, to
    read more about resolution checkout the [dedicated Resolution
    Section](/resolution).

One of the major parts of the ENS protocol is the resolution process. The Resolution process at its core is the process of converting a human-readable name to a machine-readable address.

Though there is a lot of magic under the hood, the ENS system consists of two main directions:

- [Forward Resolution](#forward-resolution)
- [Reverse Resolution](#reverse-resolution)

## Forward Resolution

Forwards resolution is the process of going **from name to address**. As well as to load the records associated to a users name.
These records include but are not limited to **discord**, **twitter**, **github**, **email**, **timezone**, and more.

<div className="not-prose card1 p-4">
  <div className="flex justify-center items-start gap-6">
    <Usertag />
    <div className="flex h-14 items-center">‚û°Ô∏è</div>
    <div className="card1 p-4 !my-0 rounded-md w-64 whitespace-normal break-all">
        <div>
            <span className="font-extrabold">Address:</span> 0x225...c3B5
        </div>
        <div>
            <span className="font-extrabold">Twitter:</span> @lucemansnl
        </div>
        <div>
            <span className="font-extrabold">Discord:</span> lucemans#2066
        </div>
        <div>
            <span className="font-extrabold">...</span>
        </div>
    </div>

  </div>
</div>

Implementing forwards resolution in a dApp can be as simple as using a single line of code!
To learn more about how to implement forwards resolution, check out the [Address Resolution](/web/address) documentation.

## Reverse Resolution

Reverse resolution is the process of going **from address to name**. As well as to load the records associated to a users name.

This tends to be used for things like:

-   Showing a user their name
-   Showing a user their records
-   Showing a user their avatar

<div className="not-prose card1 p-4">
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center gap-6">
        <div className="card1 p-4 !my-0 rounded-md whitespace-normal break-all">
            <div>0x225...c3B5</div>
        </div>
        <div className="flex h-20 items-center">‚û°Ô∏è</div>
        <Usertag />
    </div>
</div>
