# Subdomains

Names come in handy in many situations. We believe that any place an address is used, a name should be able to be used instead.
The smart contracts you interact with have names, the deposit address for your favorite exchange has a name, your favorite DAO has a name, or maybe you use subnames to keep your wallets organized.

Luckily, the ENS Protocol has so much to offer for you to play with. There are a variety of ways you can give out subdomains to your apps users, set them up for yourself, or more.

If you are interested in naming smart-contracts specifically, check out the [Naming Smart Contracts](/web/naming-contracts) page.

## Pre-built Tooling

### NameWrapper

The [NameWrapper](/subnames/wrapper) is a smart contract that allows you to issue trustless on-chain subdomains.
NameWrapper subdomains come in the form of [ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) NFTs, which can be transferred, sold, or traded.

In addition NameWrapper subnames have fuzes which allow you to limit permissions, or even emmancipate a subname entirely.
You can interact directly with the namewrapper from the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app/).

### Legacy Subdomains

In the previous version of the ETHRegistrar you could register subdomains for a name. These subdomains are always owner-controlled, and can be transferred.
They are also stored on-chain, but are not in the form of an ERC1155.

You can register a legacy subdomain by calling the `setSubnodeRecord` function on the [ENS Registry](/registry/ens) contract.

## Writing your own Resolver

You can always opt to [write your own resolver](/resolvers/writing) in solidity, doing so will give you absolute programatic control over how resolution for your name and its subnames will behave.
Requires deploying a smart contract.

### Offchain & Layer 2

To load data from an off-chain location, such as layer 2, database, or file.
A resolver can leverage [CCIP Read](/resolvers/ccip) to load data from an off-chain location.

Tooling has been built to allow you to easily deploy a template resolver, or leverage a library to load data from offchain.

#### EVM Gateway

The [EVM Gateway](https://github.com/ensdomains/evmgateway) is a set of solidity tooling that allows you to write a resolver that can trustlessly load storage slots from an EVM-compatible chain.
It currently supports *Optimism* and *Arbitrum*.

#### CCIP Tools

If you are looking to skip writing & deploying a contract to mainnet you can use [ccip.tools](https://ccip.tools)'s proxy factory.
This allows you to easily, and at low deployment cost deploy a resolver that can load data from a CCIP endpoint.

This allows you to easily deploy a resolver that can load from your [Gateway API](/resolvers/ccip) without having to write any solidity code.
