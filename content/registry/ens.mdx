# The Registry

The ENS registry is the core contract that lies at the heart of ENS resolution. All ENS lookups start by querying the registry. The registry maintains a list of domains, recording the owner, resolver, and TTL for each, and allows the owner of a domain to make changes to that data.

The ENS registry is specified in [EIP 137](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-137).

## Why Registries?

Top-Level Domains (TLDs), like `.eth`, `.com`, and `.test`, are owned by smart contracts called <b>registrars</b>, which specify rules governing the allocation of their names.
Anyone may, by following the rules imposed by these registrar contracts, obtain ownership of a domain for their own use.

| TLD                 | Registrar Contract                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `[root]`            | [The Registry](/registry/ens)          |
| `.eth`              | [ETH Registry](/registry/eth)          |
| `.com`, `.xyz`, etc | [DNS Registrar](/registry/dns)         |
| `.addr.reverse`     | [Reverse Registrar](/registry/reverse) |

## Who owns the root Registry?

The [ENS Registry](https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e) is owned by the [ENS Root](https://etherscan.io/address/0xaB528d626EC275E3faD363fF1393A41F581c5897) which is owned by the [ENS DAO Wallet](https://etherscan.io/address/0xFe89cc7aBB2C4183683ab71653C4cdc9B02D44b7).
To verify this you can run the `owner` function on the registry & root contracts.

## Other Functions

```ts
// Get Owner
ENS.owner(bytes32 node) view returns (address)
// Get Resolver
ENS.resolver(bytes32 node) view returns (address)
// Get TTL
ENS.ttl(bytes32 node) view returns (uint64)
// Get Approval
ENS.isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) view returns (bool)
// Check Record Existence
ENS.recordExists(bytes32 node) view returns (bool)
```

```ts
// Set Owner (only callable by current owner)
ENS.setOwner(bytes32 node, address owner)
// Set Resolver
ENS.setResolver(bytes32 node, address resolver)
// Set TTL
ENS.setTTL(bytes32 node, uint64 ttl)
// Set Subnode Owner
ENS.setSubnodeOwner(bytes32 node, bytes32 label, address owner)
// Set Multiple (convenience function (setResolver, setTTL, setOwner))
ENS.setRecord(bytes32 node, address owner, address resolver, uint64 ttl)
// Set Multiple Subnode
ENS.setSubnodeRecord(bytes32 node, bytes32 label, address owner, address resolver, uint64 ttl)
// Set Approval
ENS.setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved)
```

Events

```ts
// Transfer Event
event Transfer(bytes32 indexed node, address owner)
// New Resolver Event
event NewResolver(bytes32 indexed node, address resolver)
// New TTL Event
event NewTTL(bytes32 indexed node, uint64 ttl)
// New Owner Event
event NewOwner(bytes32 indexed node, bytes32 indexed label, address owner)
```
