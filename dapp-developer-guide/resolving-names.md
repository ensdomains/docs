# Resolving Names

## Looking up Ethereum addresses

The simplest and most frequently used function in ENS is resolving a name. Names can have many types of data associated with them; the most common is an Ethereum address. Resolving a name to an Ethereum address using a library is simple:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ethereum-ens" %}
```javascript
var address = await ens.resolver('alice.eth').addr();
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="web3.js" %}
```javascript
var address = ens.getAddress('alice.eth');
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="ethjs-ens" %}
```javascript
var address = await ens.lookup('alice.eth');
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="ethers.js" %}
```javascript
var address = await provider.resolveName('alice.eth');
```

ethers.js also supports using ENS names anywhere you would use an address, meaning you often do not need to directly call `resolveName`. For example, to look up an account's balance, you can do:

```javascript
var balance = await provider.getBalance('alice.eth');
```

Or, to instantiate a contract:

```javascript
const abi = [
  "function getValue() view returns (string value)",
  "function setValue(string value)"
];
const contract = new ethers.Contract('contract.alice.eth', abi, provider);
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="go-ens" %}
```go
address, err := ens.Resolve(client, "alice.eth")
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="web3.py" %}
```text
address = ns.address('alice.eth')
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="web3j" %}
```java
String address = ens.resolve("alice.eth");
```

web3j also supports using ENS names anywhere you would use an address, meaning you often do not need to directly interact with the `EnsResolver` object. For example, t o instantiate a contract interface, you can do:

```java
YourSmartContract contract = YourSmartContract.load(
        "contract.alice.eth", web3j, credentials, GAS_PRICE, GAS_LIMIT);
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Resolution without a library is a three step process:

1. Normalise and hash the name - see [name processing](../contract-api-reference/name-processing.md) for details.
2. Call `resolver()` on the ENS registry, passing in the output of step 1. This returns the address of the resolver responsible for the name.
3. Using the [resolver interface](https://github.com/ensdomains/resolvers/blob/master/contracts/Resolver.sol), call `addr()` on the resolver address returned in step 2, passing in the hashed name calculated in step 1.

Multicoin address resolution support is implemented with an additional overload on `addr()`.  To resolve a multicoin address, supply both the namehash and the [SLIP44](https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0044.md) chain ID of the cryptocurrency whose address you want to resolve. For example, to resolve a Bitcoin address, you would call `addr(hash, 0)`. Note that the returned address will be in binary representation, and so will need decoding to a text-format address; for details, see [EIP 2304](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2304).

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are resolving addr\(\) records, you MUST treat a return value from the resolver of 0x00â€¦00 as that record being unset. Failing to do so could result in users accidentally sending funds to the null address if they have configured a resolver in ENS, but not set the resolver record!
{% endhint %}

## Looking up other resources

ENS supports many types of resources besides Ethereum addresses, including content hashes for data stored in Swarm or IPFS, contract interfaces \(ABIs\), and text-based metadata. The process for looking these up varies from library to library; for specific details see your chosen library's documentation.

Resolving these content types without a library follows the same 3-step process detailed above; simply call the relevant method on the resolver in step 3 instead of `addr()`.

## Reverse Resolution

While 'regular' resolution involves mapping from a name to an address, reverse resolution maps from an address back to a name - or other metadata. ENS supports reverse resolution to allow applications to display ENS names in place of hexadecimal addresses.

Reverse resolution is accomplished via the special purpose domain _addr.reverse_ and the resolver function `name()`. _addr.reverse_ is owned by a special purpose registrar contract that allocates subdomains to the owner of the matching address - for instance, the address _0x00000000000C2E074eC69A0dFb2997BA6C7d2e1e_ may claim the name _314159265dd8dbb310642f98f50c066173c1259b.addr.reverse_, and configure a resolver and records on it. The resolver in turn supports the `name()` function, which returns the name associated with that address.

{% hint style="danger" %}
ENS does not enforce the accuracy of reverse records - for instance, anyone may claim that the name for their address is 'alice.eth'. To be certain that the claim is accurate, you must always perform a forward resolution for the returned name and check it matches the original address.
{% endhint %}

Most libraries provide functionality for doing reverse resolution:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ethereum-ens" %}
```javascript
const address = '0x1234...';
var name = await ens.reverse(address).name()
// Check to be sure the reverse record is correct.
if(address != await ens.resolver(name).addr()) {
  name = null;
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="web3.js" %}
Not supported.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="ethjs-ens" %}
```javascript
var address = '0x1234...';
var name = await ens.reverse(address);
// Check to be sure the reverse record is correct.
if(address != await ens.lookup(name)) {
  name = null;
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="ethers.js" %}
```text
var address = '0x1234...';
var name = await provider.lookupAddress(address);
// ethers.js automatically checks that the forward resolution matches.
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="go-ens" %}
```go
name, err := ens.ReverseResolve(client, common.HexToAddress("0x1234...")
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="web3.py" %}
```python
address = '0x1234...'
name = ns.reverse(address)
# Check to be sure the reverse record is correct.
if address != ns.address(name):
  name = None
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="web3j" %}
```java
String address = "0x1234...";
String name = ens.reverseResolve(address);
// Check to be sure the reverse record is correct.
if(address != ens.resolve(name)) {
  name = null;
}
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Reverse resolution without a library follows the same pattern as forward resolution: Get the resolver for `1234....addr.reverse`\(where _1234..._ is the address you want to reverse-resolve\), and call the `name()` function on that resolver. Then, perform a forward resolution to verify the record is accurate.
